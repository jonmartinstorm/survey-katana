In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O CPSs.

Cyber-physical\n   power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of\n   attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and\n   attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers\n   require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for\n   simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such\n   a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction\n   to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the\n   development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems.\n   The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital\n   simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a\n   MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine.

Cyber-physical power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems. The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers. Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system {[}11]. Fault, contingency and cyber-attack scenarios have been developed for both power systems.

However, there is an\n   increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to\n   malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack\n   would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this\n   paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to\n   mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take\n   advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets\n   include register status values that are used to reflect the physical\n   characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states\n   to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial\n   networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register\n   state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite\n   automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS\n   attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device\n   fingerprints, including passive and active detection.

However, there is an increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets include register status values that are used to reflect the physical characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device fingerprints, including passive and active detection. We present a prototype of the iFinger and conduct real-world experiments to validate its performance. Results show that our approach achieves 97.1\\% F1 score in ICS device identification. Furthermore, we simulate two typical ICS attacks (replacement and code modification) to validate the effectiveness of our iFinger in industrial networks. Our device fingerprints would detect those malicious attacks within 2s latency at 98.0\\% recall.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bb9"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bba"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bbb"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bbc"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bbd"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bbe"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bbf"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- IDS\n- Control used on ICS"}

With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS,\n   highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system\n   (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection\n   threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection\n   indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion\n   detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in\n   industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy\n   consumption varies according to different operation types and system\n   states.

With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS, highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy consumption varies according to different operation types and system states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation, system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm. Experimental results verify that our approach has a better detection performance than other detection methods.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf1"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf2"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf3"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf4"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf5"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf6"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5bf7"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Energy anomaly detection\n- Expermental ICS."}

The increasing interaction between industrial control systems and the outside Internet world, however, has made them an attractive target for a variety of cyber attacks, raising a great need to secure industrial control systems. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most important security precautions for industrial control systems. It can effectively detect potential attacks against industrial control systems. In this survey, we elaborate on the characteristics and the new security requirements of industrial control systems. After that, we present a new taxonomy of intrusion detection systems for industrial control systems based on different techniques: protocol analysis based, traffic mining based, and control process analysis based. In addition, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different categories of intrusion detection systems and discuss some future developments of intrusion detection systems for industrial control systems, in order to promote further research on intrusion detection technology for industrial control systems.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c22"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c23"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c24"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c25"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c26"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c27"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c28"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Survey of IDS for ICS\n- Not tested"}

For this purpose, designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks. Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks. Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge, ``Curse of dimensionality{''}. This scenario accentuates the necessity of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall, classification accuracy, and time complexity.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c76"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c77"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c78"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c79"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c7a"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c7b"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5c7c"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- IDS focus (feature identification)\n- ICS focus"}

These systems are increasingly the target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source intrusion detection systems (IDS).

Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea08a86fd2b5a0bb308af"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea08a86fd2b5a0bb308b0"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea08a86fd2b5a0bb308b1"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea08a86fd2b5a0bb308b2"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea08a86fd2b5a0bb308b3"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Focus is on testbed"}

SCADA systems were originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol communications. The proposed stateful protocol analysis approach is presented that is designed specifically for the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. Finally, the novel intrusion detection approach are implemented and validated.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d10"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"SCADA protocol","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d11"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d12"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d13"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d14"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d15"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"Electric power","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d16"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS focus\n- McLaughlin","citations":28}

SCADA systems with legacy communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems. The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally, proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are implemented and verified via Snort rules.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3a"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"Yes, IACS protocol...","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3b"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"No","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3c"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3d"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3e"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"Captured data.","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d3f"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d40"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus\n- McLaughlin","citations":68}

The proposed method is tested using MODBUS protocol used for communication between a SCADA server and field devices in a SCADA system.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d4f"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"Yes, Deterministic communication","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d50"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"No","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d51"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d52"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d53"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d54"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d55"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"To train the bloom filter IDS","answer":true}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus","citations":44}

There is a strong need to deeply excavate information from manufacturing Big Data, especially the energy consumption data, for energy-efficient manufacturing operations management and analysis. However, relevant data reduction and association analysis to support energy-efficient manufacturing are still ineffective and error-prone, especially for discrete manufacturing workshops. In this paper, an energy-aware Cyber Physical System (E-CPS) is proposed for energy Big Data analysis and recessive production anomalies detection. Firstly, E-CPS is introduced to acquire manufacturing Big Data. Then, a Big Data analysis method, including data reduction and data association analysis, is proposed to analyse the manufacturing data in the E-CPS. Considering the complexity and dynamics of manufacturing processes, an energy Big Data-driven recessive production anomalies analysis method is proposed based on deep belief networks. The proposed method in this paper realises the integrated utilisation of production Big Data and energy Big Data in the E-CPS. Further, the efficiency evaluation and recessive anomalies detection methods can be used in existing production information systems.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b64d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b64e"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b64f"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b650"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b651"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Not cybersecurity"}

The\n   emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure\n   that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase\n   efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised\n   devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges.\n   Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid\n   information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral\n   detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart\n   grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,\n   we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify\n   compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and\n   function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical\n   analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral\n   characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a\n   realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both\n   resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our\n   framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device\n   scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of\n   our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting\n   compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call\n   tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate\n   for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance\n   metrics include accuracy values between 95\\% and 99\\% for the different\n   attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that\n   the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid\n   devices' computing resources.}},\nPublisher = {{ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY}},\nAddress = {{2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA}},\nType = {{Article}},\nLanguage = {{English}},\nAffiliation = {{Babun, L (Corresponding Author), Florida Int Univ, Elect \\& Comp Engn Dept, Coll Engn \\& Comp, 10555 West Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174 USA.\n   Babun, Leonardo; Aksu, Hidayet; Uluagac, A.

Selcuk","abstract":"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article, we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include accuracy values between 95\\% and 99\\% for the different attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d95"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d96"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d97"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d98"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d99"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d9a"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5d9b"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS like CPS"}

Therefore, it is significant to enhance the\n   cybersecurity of CPES from cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new dynamic\n   attack model that takes into account the dynamic characteristics of\n   energy systems is developed based on traditional false data injection\n   attack. The proposed attack model can be used to describe the attack\n   behaviors of a malicious attacker over time. Then, we propose a new\n   generalized interval state estimator to quantify the normal fluctuations\n   of all CPES state variables. In this state estimator, the Unscented\n   Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to predict the real-time operating level of\n   the state variables. Copula theory is introduced to model the prediction\n   uncertainty of sustainable energy and load as a set of conditional\n   quantiles. We then model the normal fluctuation range of each CPES state\n   as a bilevel nonlinear programming problem based on the worst case\n   analysis. Consequently, an anomaly detection method is developed to\n   detect whether there is an attack or not in the CPES. In this method,\n   any state variable that falls outside its estimated interval is\n   considered an abnormal point.

Therefore, it is significant to enhance the cybersecurity of CPES from cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new dynamic attack model that takes into account the dynamic characteristics of energy systems is developed based on traditional false data injection attack. The proposed attack model can be used to describe the attack behaviors of a malicious attacker over time. Then, we propose a new generalized interval state estimator to quantify the normal fluctuations of all CPES state variables. In this state estimator, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to predict the real-time operating level of the state variables. Copula theory is introduced to model the prediction uncertainty of sustainable energy and load as a set of conditional quantiles. We then model the normal fluctuation range of each CPES state as a bilevel nonlinear programming problem based on the worst case analysis. Consequently, an anomaly detection method is developed to detect whether there is an attack or not in the CPES. In this method, any state variable that falls outside its estimated interval is considered an abnormal point. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic attack model and the effectiveness of the anomaly detection method have been extensively validated on test systems in power and energy society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

In this paper, a data driven cyber-physical system is introduced to detect landslides. This system is composed of Wi-Sun acceleration sensors, which can detect the acceleration of the nearby environment in 3D domain, and the sensors are linked with the router (act as `sink' node) via Wi-Sun transmission (i.e. IEEE802.15.4g). The details of the detection system are explained and the landslide detection mechanism with low computational complexity is proposed. A traffic reduction method is proposed thereafter to help reduce the data needed for transmission by exploring the intra-correlations of the sensor data. This method can save the energy consumption without degrading the detection performance. Field test is conducted and the results show that the landslide can be detected and amount of data to be transmitted can be reduced, which verifies the system's effectiveness.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6c5"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6c6"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6c7"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6c8"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6c9"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is operations focus"}

In order to evaluate CALENDAR with different ICPS topologies (e.g., different ICPS sizes), a scalability test was performed considering the information captured from the production lines domain.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6d1"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6d2"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6d3"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6d4"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b6d5"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on operations"}

Finally, a numerical example is proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the above conclusions.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e05"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e06"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e07"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e08"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e09"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e0a"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e0b"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

They have the capability to measure\n   time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast\n   sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and\n   data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120\n   samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher\n   data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a\n   challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this\n   paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning\n   techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying\n   system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this\n   paper.

Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120 samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm has been tested in real-time using an OPAL-RT digital real-time simulator.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b73d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b73e"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b73f"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b740"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0a86f71995a5e32b741"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on operations"}

In such a network, to\n   authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be\n   traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they\n   are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not\n   only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the\n   data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving\n   on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification\n   problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real\n   bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device\n   AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a\n   light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the\n   feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of\n   random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation\n   mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed\n   approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the\n   network as cloud computation and communication is removed.

In such a network, to authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the network as cloud computation and communication is removed. Our proposal is verified on real datasets of the face, iris, and fingerprint bio-modalities provided by the Warsaw, Replay-Attack, and LiveDet 2015 Crossmatch benchmark, respectively. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art architectures in four out of six tests.

However, the safety of CPS can be\n   significantly threatened by increased security vulnerabilities and the\n   lack of flexibility in accepting various normal environments or\n   conditions. To enhance safety and security in CPS, a common and\n   cost-effective strategy is to employ the model-based detection\n   technique; however, detecting faults in practice is challenging due to\n   model and environment uncertainties. In this paper, we present a novel\n   generation method of the adaptive threshold required for providing\n   dependability for the model-based fault detection system. In particular,\n   we focus on statistical and information theoretic analysis to consider\n   the model and environment uncertainties, and non-linear programming to\n   determine an adaptive threshold as an equilibrium point in terms of\n   adaptability and sensitivity. To do this, we assess the normality of the\n   data obtained from real sensors, define performance measures\n   representing the system requirements, and formulate the optimal\n   threshold problem. In addition, in order to efficiently exploit the\n   adaptive thresholds, we design the storage so that it is added to the\n   basic structure of the model-based detection system. By executing the\n   performance evaluation with various fault scenarios by varying\n   intensities, duration and types of faults injected, we prove that the\n   proposed method is well designed to cope with uncertainties. In\n   particular, against noise faults, the proposed method shows nearly 100\\%\n   accuracy, recall, and precision at each of the operation, regardless of\n   the intensity and duration of faults. Under the constant faults, it\n   achieves the accuracy from 85.4\\% to 100\\%, the recall of 100\\% from the\n   lowest 54.2\\%, and the precision of 100\\%.

However, the safety of CPS can be significantly threatened by increased security vulnerabilities and the lack of flexibility in accepting various normal environments or conditions. To enhance safety and security in CPS, a common and cost-effective strategy is to employ the model-based detection technique; however, detecting faults in practice is challenging due to model and environment uncertainties. In this paper, we present a novel generation method of the adaptive threshold required for providing dependability for the model-based fault detection system. In particular, we focus on statistical and information theoretic analysis to consider the model and environment uncertainties, and non-linear programming to determine an adaptive threshold as an equilibrium point in terms of adaptability and sensitivity. To do this, we assess the normality of the data obtained from real sensors, define performance measures representing the system requirements, and formulate the optimal threshold problem. In addition, in order to efficiently exploit the adaptive thresholds, we design the storage so that it is added to the basic structure of the model-based detection system. By executing the performance evaluation with various fault scenarios by varying intensities, duration and types of faults injected, we prove that the proposed method is well designed to cope with uncertainties. In particular, against noise faults, the proposed method shows nearly 100\\% accuracy, recall, and precision at each of the operation, regardless of the intensity and duration of faults. Under the constant faults, it achieves the accuracy from 85.4\\% to 100\\%, the recall of 100\\% from the lowest 54.2\\%, and the precision of 100\\%. It also gives the accuracy of 100\\% from the lowest 83.2\\%, the recall of 100\\% from the lowest 43.8\\%, and the precision of 100\\% against random faults. These results indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly better performance than existing dynamic threshold methods. Consequently, an extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is able to accurately and reliably detect the faults and achieve high levels of adaptability and sensitivity, compared with other dynamic thresholds.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e28"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e29"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e2a"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e2b"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e2c"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e2d"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e2e"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus (possible for attacks)\n- Maybe ICS like CPS \n"}

Simulation studies highlight the ability of a set-theoretic approach to disclose persistent and intermittent attack patterns even when they occur at the same time with changes in the power load demand.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e3d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e3e"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e3f"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e40"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e41"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e42"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5e43"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS like CPS"}

As such, and with the cyber layer becoming a central component of WDS operations, these systems are at a greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks. This paper offers a model-based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of WDSs combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically based rules alone.

Such systems now serve as the backbone to numerous\n   critical infrastructure applications, from smart grids to IoT\n   installations. Scalable and seamless operation of such CPSs requires\n   sophisticated tools for monitoring the time series progression of the\n   system, dynamically tracking relationships, and issuing alerts about\n   anomalies to operators.

Scalable and seamless operation of such CPSs requires sophisticated tools for monitoring the time series progression of the system, dynamically tracking relationships, and issuing alerts about anomalies to operators.

Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec2"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec3"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec4"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec5"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec6"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec7"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5ec8"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

This paper offer a methodology for identifying cyber-attacks based on logical rules that are based on detailed hydraulic understanding of the WDS combined with a machine learning event detection system for identification of complex cyber-attacks that cannot be fully identified by the hydraulic based rules alone.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f5c"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f5d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f5e"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f5f"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f60"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f61"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f62"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS like CPS"}

A\n   quantizer maps the amount of information from a continuous space to a\n   finite set which is compatible with the limited communication bandwidth.\n   Considering the quantized measurement output, a detection algorithm by\n   means of a set-membership filtering approach will be proposed.

This constraint arises when an attack detection system is located at a remote site and so the required signals, measurement output and control signals, need to be transmitted over a digital communication channel. Therefore, data before being sent to the remote site must be encoded and converted from analog signals to digital signals by using quantizer. A quantizer maps the amount of information from a continuous space to a finite set which is compatible with the limited communication bandwidth. Considering the quantized measurement output, a detection algorithm by means of a set-membership filtering approach will be proposed. The algorithm consists of a prediction ellipsoid set and an estimation ellipsoid set updated with the quantized measurement output. The detection method depends on the existence of intersection between two sets computed by the filter. Simulation results for some possible physical and cyber attacks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f7f"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f80"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f81"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f82"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f83"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f84"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5f85"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

However, current detection\n   approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria,\n   paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already\n   overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed\n   recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we\n   design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for\n   early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients.

However, current detection approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria, paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First, a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria. With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and provide timely decision supports.

In the abnormal operational occurrence, the chi-square detector is able to distinguish adversarial cyber-attacks from ordinary random failures.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fe8"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fe9"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fea"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5feb"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fec"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fed"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca5fee"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Deteciton focus\n- ICS focus\n- Very interesting"}

We also present results from evaluating our algorithms on an unlabeled dataset consisting of anomalies due to cyber attacks and physical faults in a commercial building system.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6004"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"Controsl physical world","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6005"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"Yes, both physical and cyber, and correlates!!!","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6006"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"not mentioned","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6007"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"Correlate with network data","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6008"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"no","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6009"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"Building automation","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca600a"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"Yes, promising bayesian networks","answer":true}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Maybe ICS like CPS","citations":20}

In the first part, we develop a tractable approach to design a robust residual generator to detect and isolate faults in high dimensional nonlinear systems. Previous approaches on fault detection and isolation problems are either confined to linear systems or they are only applicable to low dimensional dynamics with more specific structures. In contrast, we propose a novel methodology to robustify a linear residual generator for a nonlinear system in the presence of certain disturbance signatures. To this end, we formulate the problem into the framework of quadratic programming which enables us to solve relatively high dimensional systems. In the second part, the application is motivated by the emerging problem of cyber security in power networks. We provide description of a multi-machine power system that represents a two-area power system, and we model a cyber-physical attack emanating from the vulnerabilities introduced by the interaction between IT infrastructure and power system. The algorithm developed in the first part is finally used to diagnose such an intrusion before the functionality of the power system is disrupted.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6020"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"Controls the physical world","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6021"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"Yes, only data from the physical world","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6022"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"Not specified","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6023"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"Enriched with how a power system is supposed to work","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6024"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"Only simulation","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6025"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"Electri power (IEEE 118-bus)","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6026"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus\n- Detection is used for cybersecurity as well\n- Still very theoretical","citations":30}

These attacks actually are\n   undetectable by the most advanced system call monitors as they issue no\n   system calls and are stealthy enough to transfer control to hijacked\n   library functions without letting their saved instruction Pointers get\n   stored on stack. We exploit the fact that implementations of control\n   protocols running in control systems, which in turn are attached to\n   physical systems such as power plants and electrical substations,\n   exhibit strong regularities in terms of sequences of function calls and\n   system calls issued during protocol transactions. The main idea behind\n   the proposed approach is to introduce NULL function calls within a\n   Modbus binary and to apply the shuffle operation between them and\n   existing function calls.

These attacks actually are undetectable by the most advanced system call monitors as they issue no system calls and are stealthy enough to transfer control to hijacked library functions without letting their saved instruction Pointers get stored on stack. We exploit the fact that implementations of control protocols running in control systems, which in turn are attached to physical systems such as power plants and electrical substations, exhibit strong regularities in terms of sequences of function calls and system calls issued during protocol transactions. The main idea behind the proposed approach is to introduce NULL function calls within a Modbus binary and to apply the shuffle operation between them and existing function calls. We then devise and implement a product machine capable of recognizing the shuffle representation of function call and system call regularities. A sensor uses a unidirectional interprocess communication channel based on shared memory to receive profile data from a Modbus process, and subsequently submits them to the product machine. We describe an experimental evaluation of our model on an ARM-based Modbus device and demonstrate that the proposed model overcomes the limitations of state of the art approaches with regard to detection of persistent interposition attacks on control systems.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6027"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"Yes, real time communication","answer":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6028"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"No, nothing","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6029"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca602a"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca602b"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"Simulation","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca602c"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"No sector","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca602d"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"Yes, in learning phase of the model","answer":true}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus","citations":10}

To be specific, three performance indicators are first introduced based on Bellman equation to predict system performance degradations for industrial processes with the aid of machine learning techniques. Based on them, three PSFD schemes are proposed by embedding the performance indicators as supervising information. In this context, the data-driven implementation of PSFD schemes are investigated for linear systems with unmeasurable state variables. A case study on rolling mill process, a typical benchmark in the steel manufacturing processes, is given at the end of this article to illustrate the applications of the proposed fault detection schemes.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f19a"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f19b"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f19c"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f19d"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f19e"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on operations"}

Further, this visual sensory information is used to automatically generate control logic for tracking and monitoring a conveyor platform and can be smoothly integrated with industrial control system enabling real-time closed loop operations.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f1f4"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f1f5"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f1f6"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f1f7"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f1f8"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on operations"}

ICS are devices used to operate and\n   automate industrial processes. Due to the increasing popularity of the\n   Internet, these devices are getting more and more connected to the\n   Internet. These devices will, if not hidden, be shown on Shodan. This\n   study uses Shodan, together with data found by other researches to plot\n   the trends of these ICS devices. The studied trends focus on the country\n   percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The results show\n   that all studied countries, except the United States, have decreased\n   their percentage of world total ICS devices. We suspect that this does\n   not represent the real story, as companies are getting better at hiding\n   their devices from online crawlers. Our results also show that the usage\n   of old ICS protocols is increasing.

ICS are devices used to operate and automate industrial processes. Due to the increasing popularity of the Internet, these devices are getting more and more connected to the Internet. These devices will, if not hidden, be shown on Shodan. This study uses Shodan, together with data found by other researches to plot the trends of these ICS devices. The studied trends focus on the country percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The results show that all studied countries, except the United States, have decreased their percentage of world total ICS devices. We suspect that this does not represent the real story, as companies are getting better at hiding their devices from online crawlers. Our results also show that the usage of old ICS protocols is increasing.

The different devices within\n   the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an\n   isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of\n   the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the\n   manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration\n   with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks\n   are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by\n   malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous\n   update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts\n   from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection\n   of ICS.\n   Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach\n   performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach\n   (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization\n   of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training\n   techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for\n   real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat\n   detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep\n   learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern\n   recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure.\n   Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the\n   domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of\n   huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of\n   deep learning to design our detection model.\n   Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed\n   in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data\n   for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural\n   network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained\n   using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about\n   the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed\n   detection models is that the models are adaptive where training\n   procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt\n   new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at\n   the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks\n   and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks.\n   Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and\n   values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes,\n   learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models\n   find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other\n   parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a\n   real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed\n   approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms\n   and obtain similar performances with earlier semi supervised work (Huda\n   et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model.

Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure. Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of deep learning to design our detection model. Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed detection models is that the models are adaptive where training procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks. Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes, learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms and obtain similar performances with earlier semi supervised work (Huda et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model.

Experimental results clearly show that the proposed approach has obvious advantages of classification accuracy and detection efficiency.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca609e"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca609f"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60a0"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60a1"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60a2"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60a3"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60a4"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detetion focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state\n   dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an\n   attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system\n   provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowledge of the\n   network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of\n   residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel\n   state-aware anomaly detection technique.

The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real EMS site and simulated attacks.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60cf"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d0"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d1"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d2"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d3"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d4"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca60d5"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS like CPS"}

While similar statistical side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically, during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is, therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC.

Conclusions: The setting of interference limits (cut-off) for each used test/method, and the study of preanalytical variability will assist to the results harmonization for this quality indicator.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f35c"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f35d"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f35e"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f35f"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0af4511045a8415f360"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Not ICS"}

This method consists of three processes: SCADA data preprocessing, automatic feature extraction, and ensemble icing detection model construction. Specifically, deep autoencoders network is employed to learn multilevel fault features from the complex SCADA data adaptively. And the ensemble technique is utilized to make full use of all the extracted features from different hidden layers of the deep autoencoders network to build the ensemble icing detection model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the data collected from actual wind farms. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively extract valuable fault features from the complex SCADA data, but also obtains higher detection accuracy and generalization capability compared with conventional machine learning models and individual deep learning model.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ac0"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ac1"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ac2"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ac3"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ac4"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on operations"}

The main challenges of the wind turbine fault detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall accuracy of 98.2\\%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition monitoring in wind turbines.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ade"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318adf"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ae0"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ae1"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318ae2"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is fault focused"}

Their impact on modern Engine Control Room operations is no less significant. The state of an alarm system serves as an indication of the extent to which the ship's operations are under management control. Thus, the design of efficient and reliable alarm monitoring system is vital for safe and sound operations. Although several design techniques have been proposed, all the proposed design methods employ sophisticated and expensive approaches in resolving alarm issues. In this paper, a cheap, yet reliable and efficient alarm design method for engine room device monitoring is presented. The design method employs PLCs and SCADA-based system and adopts certain basic design requirements of alarm monitoring system presented in literary works. Reasons for such a design method are highlighted, and the programming platforms for the design are given. The strengths and weaknesses of some design methods presented in some published works are reported and solutions to such problems are proposed. The proposed design technique, including fault diagnostic algorithm, have been subjected to real-time online testing at the shipyard, specifically Changjiang Waterway Bureau, China (ship name-Ning Dao 501). The testing results proved that this design technique is reliable, efficient and effective for online engine control room device monitoring.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318afc"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318afd"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318afe"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318aff"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0b598fd7e5aa5318b00"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is fault focused"}

Asset management\n   using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the\n   reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them\n   more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for\n   maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind\n   turbines.

Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results demonstrate capability and efficiency of the proposed method.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca618c"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca618d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca618e"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca618f"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6190"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6191"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6192"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus"}

We establish that our coding scheme in conjunction with the cosine similarity detector provides promising detection performance.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca623b"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca623c"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca623d"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca623e"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca623f"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6240"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6241"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0c85a80a45b12392430"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0c85a80a45b12392431"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0c85a80a45b12392432"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0c85a80a45b12392433"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0c85a80a45b12392434"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Not ICS like CPS\n- Detection is focused on operations "}

This poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure due to potentially shorter lifetime, lower reliability, and poorer performance from these counterfeit new chips. Recently, we have proposed a highly effective approach for detecting such chips by exploiting the power-up state of on-chip SRAMs. Due to the symmetry of the memory array layout, an equal number of cells power-up to the 0 and 1 logic states in a new unused SRAM; this ratio gets skewed in time due to uneven NBTI aging from normal usage in the field. Although this solution is very effective in detecting recycled ICs, its applicability is somewhat limited as a large number older designs do not have large on-chip memories. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach based on the initial power-up state of scan flip-flops, which are present in virtually every digital circuit. Since the flip-flops, unlike SRAM cells, are generally not perfectly symmetrical in layout, an equal number of scan cells will not power-up to 0 or 1 logic states in most designs. Consequently, a stable time zero reference of 50% logic 0s and 1s cannot be used for determining the subsequent usage of a chip. To overcome this key limitation, we propose a novel solution in this paper that reliably identifies used ICs from testing the part alone, without the need for any additional reference data or even the netlist of the circuit. Through scan testing of the IC, we first identify a significant number of asymmetrically stressed flip-flops in the design, divided into two groups. One group of flip-flops is selected such that it mostly experiences the 1 logic state during functional operation, while the other group mostly experiences the 0 state. The resulting differential stress during operation causes growing disparity over time in the number of 0s (and 1s) observed in these two groups at power-up. When new and unaged, these two groups behave similarly, with similar percentage of 1s (or 0s). However, over time the differential stress makes these counts diverge. We show that this changing count can be a measure of operational aging.

Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in TSMC's 0.35μm technology, we also assess the effectiveness of a side channel-based statistical analysis method in detecting this hardware Trojan.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0ce7c480d5b33461919"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0ce7c480d5b3346191a"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0ce7c480d5b3346191b"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0ce7c480d5b3346191c"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0ce7c480d5b3346191d"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Not ICS"}

In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration techniques for practical VLSI chips.

Then we propose a new formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing temperature. On average, 10% increase in temperature yields about 10X wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM, and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10 years down to a few hours (about 105 acceleration) under the 150°C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.},\nkeywords={ageing;copper;electromigration;failure (mechanical);failure analysis;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;nanoelectronics;VLSI;voids (solid);accelerating electromigration;fast failure detection;practical testing;electromigration induced failures;dual damascene copper interconnects;wearout-acceleration techniques;practical VLSI chips;three-phase physics;EM aging process;general multisegment interconnect wires;EM mortality check;EM failure process;reservoir-enhanced acceleration;multisegment interconnects;reservoir structures;reservoir accelerations;CMOS IC;time 10.0 year;temperature 150.0 degC;size 10.0 nm;Wires;Acceleration;Stress;Resistance;Current density;Integrated circuits;Reliability},\ndoi={10.1109/ASPDAC.2018.8297392},\nISSN={2153-697X},\nmonth={Jan},}","year":2018,"authors":"Z. {Sun} and S. {Sadiqbatcha} and H. {Zhao} and S.

The results showed that both known and unknow anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0d974b22d5b6eb6d97d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0d974b22d5b6eb6d97e"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0d974b22d5b6eb6d97f"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0d974b22d5b6eb6d980"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0d974b22d5b6eb6d981"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- SCADA focus\n- Duplicate"}

In the application control layer, a regularized sparse deep belief network model is introduced to characterize the misuse behavior for detecting potential attacks. Extensive validation and comparative experiments have been conducted on a numerical simulation system and a comprehensive ICPS simulation platform by using OPNET and a commonly-used benchmark simplified Tennessee Eastman process (STEP) based on Matlab/Simulink. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically distributed intrusion detection method can efficiently recognize potential and covert cyber-attacks in each ICPSs link with low false alarm rate and missing detection rate, which lays a foundation for the overall security monitoring of ICPSs","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a4"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a5"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a6"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a7"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a8"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62a9"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62aa"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

Then, dimensions of attributes within classes are reduced based on t-Distributed-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) so that the low-dimensional attributes can be more full and more concise in reflecting the WT attributes. Finally, the detection model is trained and the normal or abnormal state is detected by the classification result 0 or 1 respectively. Experiments consists of three cases with SCADA data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper presents a sine-cosine optimization based recurrent neural network (SCO-RNN) to detect the cyber physical attacks against SCADA systems and the performance of the proposed SCO-RNN was validated using the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset in terms of accuracy and detection rate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62ea"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62eb"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62ec"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62ed"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62ee"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62ef"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca62f0"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- ICS like CPS"}

This article aims to contribute to assess the state-of-the-art, identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas. To achieve these objectives, we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet environment.

This article aims to contribute to assess the state-of-the-art, identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas. To achieve these objectives, we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet environment.

The result shows that the proposed AAKR model is able to detect the MITM and DoS attacks effectively with almost no false alarms. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6314"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6315"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6316"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6317"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6318"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6319"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca631a"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

The approach applies the information in supervisory control and data acquisition systems as data input. First, machine learning is used to estimate the temperature signals of the gearbox component. Then the approach analyzes the deviations between the estimated values and the measurements of the signals.

It is shown that the anomaly detection model constructed by the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) method has high accuracy, and the Decision Tree method can commendably detect the intrusion behavior. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca633e"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca633f"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method use data from the physical world?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6340"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6341"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6342"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6343"},"text":"What sector is the IACS used in the article from?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f4e05e82510b8f148ca6344"},"text":"Do they propose use of machine learning?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection focus\n- Possible ICS like CPS"}

Then a more classical approach using data coming from a single turbine will be tested on two different generator failures to compare the results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0f14866015bfac20bde"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0f14866015bfac20bdf"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0f14866015bfac20be0"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0f14866015bfac20be1"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1ea0f14866015bfac20be2"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0,"notes":"- Detection is focused on faults"}

Wind turbines are generally placed in remote locations and are subject to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes. Consequently, the failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause loss of revenue due to long down times. Asset management in wind turbines can aid in assessing and improving the reliability and availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Maintenance policies play an important role in asset management and different maintenance models have been developed for wind turbine applications. Typically, mathematical models for maintenance optimization provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. Age based preventive maintenance schedules provide the owner with the possibility to financially plan for maintenance activities for the entire lifetime of the wind turbine by providing the expected number of replacements for each component. However, age based preventive maintenance schedule may not consume the operating life of the wind turbine components to the maximum. Condition based maintenance scheduling has the advantage of better utilizing the operating life of the components. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling.

One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines.

One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original measurements including rotor speeds and produced power.

For example, an electric power system is subjected to intrusions via its SCADA systems; however, the instrumentation provides detectable variations in response to such interference. Presented herein is a strategy that augments state estimation methods using a Hybrid Fuzzy System for fault monitoring and diagnosis that aims to combine information from multiple domains in order to detect, isolate, identify, and mitigate threats to the system.

Existing acceleration techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about 105 × acceleration) under the 150 °C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},\nauthor_keywords={Accelerated testing;  atomic reservoirs;  atomic sinks;  back-end reliability;  electromigration;  failure analysis;  integrated circuits;  interconnects;  stressing conditions},\ndocument_type={Article},\nsource={Scopus},\n}\n","year":2020,"authors":"Sadiqbatcha, S. and Sun, Z. and Tan, S.X.-D.","abstract":"For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and validation can be carried out efficiently.

Our approach is likely to be a useful tool for automatic CP rank determination and offering a plausible multiway physiological information of individual states. © 2017 IEEE.","notes":"- Not ICS","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c9826d"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c9826e"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c9826f"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c98270"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c98271"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0}

Although HPLC chromatograms for 2/CH3OH and 2/CH 3CCl3 were the same for rifampicin crystals dissolved in respective solvents, the UV-vis data recorded for them were different in 300-375nm region. Detailed solid state 13C and 15N CP/MAS NMR and FTIR studies revealed that rifampicin (2), in contrast to 3-formylrifamycin SV (1) and its amino derivatives (3-6), can occur in pure non-ionic or zwitterionic forms in crystal and in pure these forms or a mixture of them in a powder. Multinuclear CP/MAS and FTIR studies demonstrated also that 3-6 derivatives were present exclusively in pure zwitterionic forms, both in powder and in crystal. On the basis of the solid state NMR and FTIR studies, two conformers of 3-formylrifamycin SV were detected in powder form due to the different orientations of carbonyl group of amide moiety.

The proposed structure is useful in mixed signal IC (incorporating both analog and digital block on the same chip) testing. With increasing complexity of mixed signal IC the demand of preparing the low cost testing circuitry also gets increased. Here CP-PLL is taken as the mixed signal IC wherein the proposed method uses the charge pump as stimulus generator and the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) as measuring device for testing the CP-PLL. It avoids the need of interfacing any foreign component and decreases the area overhead of whole IC.

The proposed structure is useful in mixed signal IC (incorporating both analog and digital block on the same chip) testing.

Here CP-PLL is taken as the mixed signal IC wherein the proposed method uses the charge pump as stimulus generator and the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) as measuring device for testing the CP-PLL.

Taking advantage of this sensitive detection approach, our observation that Cp and Wp may be active in NPC cells raises the possibility that EBNA2 to 6, in addition to EBNA1, may play roles in the pathogenesis of NPC.","notes":"- Not cybersecurity","questions":[{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c983f9"},"text":"Does the proposed detection method address any of the unique features IACS?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c983fa"},"text":"Does proposed detection method data or information from the physical process?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c983fb"},"text":"If the detection method gathers process data, from where and how do they gather it?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c983fc"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, do they enrich the data with other information, or correlate it with other information?","notes":"","answer":false},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f211e570cdcd4ada5c983fd"},"text":"If the detection method utilizes process data, is the method been tested or used on a live system, a real-life system, or a live test lab?","notes":"","answer":false}],"__v":0}

Equimolar mixtures of helical poly(L-alanine) with poly(glycine) and poly(L-valine) were measured under various conditions. It was found that the peak areas are proportional to the mole ratios of the different secondary structures and neither a mismatch of the Hartmann-Hahn conditions nor variations of the mixing time or the pulse interval (relaxation delay) have a significant influence on the intensity ratios. Hence, a quantitative evaluation of the 13C NMR spectra with respect to the secondary structure is feasible. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.},\ndocument_type={Article},\nsource={Scopus},\n}\n","year":1981,"authors":"Müller, D. and Kricheldorf, H.R.","abstract":"75.46 MHz 13C-NMR CP/MAS spectra of solid poly(1-alanines) with various degrees of polymerization were measured.
