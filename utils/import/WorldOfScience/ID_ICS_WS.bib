Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of industrial control systems and the diversity of
   protocols in networks, it is difficult to build intrusion detection
   models based on network characteristics and physical modeling. In order
   to build a better flow model without additional knowledge, we propose an
   intrusion detection method based on the content of network packets. The
   construction of the model is based on the idea of ZOE method. The
   similarity between flows is calculated through the sequential coverage
   algorithm, the normal flow model is established by multi-layered
   clustering algorithm, and the Count-Mean-Min Sketch is used to store and
   count the flow model. By comparing the unknown flow with the constructed
   normal flow model, we achieve the intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS). The overall experimental results on 4 ICS datasets
   show that the improved method can effectively improve the detection rate
   and reduce the false-positive rate. The detection rate reached 96.7\% on
   average, and the false-positive rate reached 0.7\% on average.}},

Title = {{iFinger: Intrusion Detection in Industrial Control Systems via

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the industrial control system (ICS) plays a vital role in
   critical infrastructures like the power grid. However, there is an
   increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to
   malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack
   would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this
   paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to
   mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take
   advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets
   include register status values that are used to reflect the physical
   characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states
   to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial
   networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register
   state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite
   automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS
   attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device
   fingerprints, including passive and active detection. We present a
   prototype of the iFinger and conduct real-world experiments to validate
   its performance. Results show that our approach achieves 97.1\% F1 score
   in ICS device identification. Furthermore, we simulate two typical ICS
   attacks (replacement and code modification) to validate the
   effectiveness of our iFinger in industrial networks. Our device
   fingerprints would detect those malicious attacks within 2s latency at
   98.0\% recall.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a prevailing area of research for several years,
   and numerous intrusion detection systems have been proposed for
   industrial control systems (ICS). In recent ages, the attacks like
   seismic net, duqu and flame against ICS infrastructures have instigated
   great harm to nuclear infrastructures and precarious facilities in
   several nations. The authors outline an approach to detect
   intrusions/anomalies in K'S. A method is presented to detect intrusions
   in real-time and automatically. The existing techniques are normally
   designed for open systems and protocols, that lacks adequate
   generalisation and resistance to acclimate to other networks, and they
   have either short detection rote or tall rate of false positive. This
   Letter presents a network packet contents behaviour and bidirectional
   Gated Recurrent Units-based method to detect intrusions in a timely and
   efficient manner. The method has proven a robust method of classifying
   intmsions/anomalies in a proficient way. Through extensive evaluation on
   an actual huge scale dataset spawned from SCADA-based gas pipeline
   network, the proposed method shows significant performance enhancement
   and outclasses the standard state-of-the-art methods with 98.68\% rate
   of accuracy. Moreover, it is also able to detect zero-day (unseen)
   attacks.}},

Title = {{A Two Stage Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Control Networks
   Based on Ethernet/IP}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 and the TCP/IP protocol suite) is
   gradually applied in industrial control system (ICS) with the
   development of information technology. It breaks the natural isolation
   of ICS, but contains no security mechanisms. An improved intrusion
   detection system (IDS), which is strongly correlated to specific
   industrial scenarios, is necessary for modern ICS. On one hand, this
   paper outlines three kinds of attack models, including infiltration
   attacks, creative forging attacks, and false data injection attacks. On
   the other hand, a two stage IDS is proposed, which contains a traffic
   prediction model and an anomaly detection model. The traffic prediction
   model, which is based on the autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA), can forecast the traffic of the ICS network in the short term
   and detect infiltration attacks precisely according to the abnormal
   changes in traffic patterns. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model,
   using a one class support vector machine (OCSVM), is able to detect
   malicious control instructions by analyzing the key field in Ethernet/IP
   packets. The confusion matrix is selected to testify to the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and two other innovative IDSs are
   used for comparison. The experiment results show that the proposed two
   stage IDS in this paper has an outstanding performance in detecting
   infiltration attacks, forging attacks, and false data injection attacks
   compared with other IDSs.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems are found often in industrial sectors and
   critical infrastructures to monitor and control industrial processes.
   Recently, the security of industrial control systems has gained much
   attention as these systems now exhibit an increased interaction with the
   Internet. In fact, classical SCADA systems are already lacking with
   security problems, and with the increased interconnectivity to the
   Internet, they are now exposed to new types of threats and
   cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most
   important security solutions used today in industrial control systems to
   detect potential attacks and malicious activities. This paper summarizes
   previous work for Intrusion Detection Systems approaches in Industrial
   Control Systems and highlights challenges and opportunities in
   implementing such solutions. We believe that such insights are valuable
   for further research in the industrial security context.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are becoming more integral to modern
   life as they are being integrated into critical infrastructure. These
   systems typically lack application layer encryption and the placement of
   common network intrusion services have large blind spots. We propose the
   novel architecture, Cloud Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention
   System (CB-IDPS), to detect and prevent threats in ICS networks by using
   software defined networking (SDN) to route traffic to the cloud for
   inspection using network function virtualization (NFV) and service
   function chaining. CB-IDPS uses Amazon Web Services to create a virtual
   private cloud for packet inspection. The CB-IDPS framework is designed
   with considerations to the ICS delay constraints, dynamic traffic
   routing, scalability, resilience, and visibility. CB-IDPS is presented
   in the context of a micro grid energy management system as the test case
   to prove that the latency of CB-IDPS is within acceptable delay
   thresholds. The implementation of CB-IDPS uses the OpenDaylight software
   for the SDN controller and commonly used network security tools such as
   Zeek and Snort. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using NFV
   in an ICS context for network security.}},

Abstract = {{Modern indusfrial control systems (ICS) are increasingly becoming
   targets of cyber attacks. Traditional security tools based on a
   signature approach are not always able to detect a new attack, the
   signature of which has not yet been described. In particular, this
   occurs during targeted attacks on indusfrial facilities. Cyber attacks
   can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and
   process equipment under its control. Therefore, to detect attacks, it is
   advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A
   reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning
   techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine
   learning (decision free algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector

Abstract = {{An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS
   networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption
   methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy
   equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities
   of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device
   fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion
   detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the
   simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware
   configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing
   time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to
   achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The
   device finger-printing-based intrusion classification and detection
   approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level
   micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the
   proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The modern industrial control systems now exhibit an increasing
   connectivity to the corporate Internet technology networks so as to make
   full use of the rich resource on the Internet. The increasing
   interaction between industrial control systems and the outside Internet
   world, however, has made them an attractive target for a variety of
   cyber attacks, raising a great need to secure industrial control
   systems. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most important
   security precautions for industrial control systems. It can effectively
   detect potential attacks against industrial control systems. In this
   survey, we elaborate on the characteristics and the new security
   requirements of industrial control systems. After that, we present a new
   taxonomy of intrusion detection systems for industrial control systems
   based on different techniques: protocol analysis based, traffic mining
   based, and control process analysis based. In addition, we analyze the
   advantages and disadvantages of different categories of intrusion
   detection systems and discuss some future developments of intrusion
   detection systems for industrial control systems, in order to promote
   further research on intrusion detection technology for industrial
   control systems.}},

Abstract = {{As closed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) gradually evolve toward
   networking, ICS data and operational processes can be easily tampered
   with by attackers, causing industrial control equipment to fail or
   become damaged. Depending on the characteristics of ICS business logic
   stability, this paper proposes a novel two-level anomaly detection
   framework to ensure that system data and business logic are safe and
   reliable. Specifically, basic information is obtained from network
   traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification.
   In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer
   algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the
   input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer
   model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the
   normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown
   attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline
   network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection
   framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance
   than several current latest technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is closely related to
   national security. With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS,
   highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system
   (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection
   threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection
   indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion
   detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in
   industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy
   consumption varies according to different operation types and system
   states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation,
   system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put
   forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on
   multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about
   power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system
   state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the
   multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm.
   Experimental results verify that our approach has a better detection
   performance than other detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of networks and computers, industrial control
   systems (ICS) have become more interconnected. Many ICS are allowed
   remote interactions through the Internet. This increases the security
   risks of being attacked. If critical infrastructure ICS are attacked,
   the consequences could be catastrophic. To protect the ICS, the
   anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (ABNIDS) are used to
   detect novel cyber-attacks by learning both normal and abnormal network
   behaviours. The quality of the attack dataset directly influences the
   accuracy of the ABNIDS. Therefore, it is important to assess the quality
   of the attack datasets used to design and develop ABNIDS. To fulfil this
   goal, this paper provides assessment criteria for evaluating ICS attack
   datasets. These new assessment criteria demonstrate the various
   requirements of the dataset and analyse the effectiveness of the dataset
   in depth. Three existing ICS attack datasets for the DNP3, S7comm and
   Modbus protocols are assessed using these criteria. We find that there
   is a range of dataset creation techniques and levels of quality with no
   dataset that meets the ideal criteria. Since no existing work discusses
   assessment criteria for ICS attack datasets, this paper would be helpful
   to evaluate and improve the ICS attack datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Sophisticated process-aware attacks targeting industrial control systems
   require adequate detection measures taking into account the physical
   process. This paper proposes an approach relying on automatically mined

   The specifications are synthesized as monitors that read the execution
   traces and report violations to the operator. In contrast to other
   approaches, a central aspect of our method consists in reducing the
   number of mined specifications suffering from redundancies. We evaluate
   our approach on a hardware-in-the-loop testbed with a complex physical

Abstract = {{In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm
   (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA)
   is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search
   ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal
   solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive
   proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and
   local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using
   the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA).
   In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve
   the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local
   optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current
   global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local
   optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test
   functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of
   support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion
   detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with
   BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of
   SVM parameters selection.}},

Abstract = {{The safety of the industrial control system directly affects the
   operation of the critical infrastructure, and the requirement of
   interconnection with external network puts the system at greater risk.
   However, due to the particularity of the industrial control system, the
   traditional intrusion detection algorithm can't be used directly. In
   this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection algorithm called
   OPSO-BPNN which is suitable for industrial control system. Our algorithm
   optimizes the particle swarm algorithm with nonlinear reduction inertia
   factor, then uses it to optimize the weight of BP neural network.
   Simulation results show that our OPSO-BPNN method proves to be feasible
   and has faster convergence rate, less iterations and higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Modbus over TCP/IP is one of the most popular industrial network
   protocol that are widely used in critical infrastructures. However,
   vulnerability of Modbus TCP protocol has attracted widely concern in the
   public. The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some
   intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper,
   we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is
   designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic.
   SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep
   inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the
   characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic
   relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep
   inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection.
   Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our
   SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and
   control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater
   interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication
   systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage
   Ethernet to allow interoperability between solutions from different
   vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect,
   created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers.
   Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely
   implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical
   systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise
   of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that
   defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets.
   This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyber-defensive
   architecture by using a Raspberry Pi based ModbusTCP control system that
   enables simulation of cyber-attacks, and illustrates a mitigation
   measure with the added feature of Modbus monitoring using Snort.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used ``air-gap{''}
   security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from
   other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect.
   Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers
   who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the
   air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little
   to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This
   paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network
   attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted
   through the network but is not inherently the data used by the
   transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the
   developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when
   differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same
   network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker
   and engineer on the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a process-oriented method for intrusion detection for
   use on Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. Network traffic from an
   ICS has a much lower volume than that from a typical IT enterprise
   network, and the traffic is much more regular (periodic) and
   predictable. Most intrusion detection systems for ICSs require
   additional capabilities. ICS network traffic is relatively predictable
   and regular and anomaly-based intrusion detection methods have been
   shown in the literature to work reasonably well. We use anomaly-based
   methods as one line of defense. We propose to strengthen ICS intrusion
   detection methods by adding two process-oriented alerting methods.
   Unlike most anomaly detection methods, these two methods are not
   configured solely by a network engineer based on inspection of network
   traffic. We utilize Critical Process Variables, which are defined by the
   plant operators themselves. The advantage is that the plant operators
   have the best knowledge of the critical assets of their system. Limiting
   values of the Critical Process Variables are defined collaboratively by
   the plant operator and the network security engineer. A network sensor
   then alerts a Human Analyst when Critical Process Variables values
   exceed the defined ranges. We also introduce a third method, which
   employs Process Network Parameter Metrics, which are also defined
   collaboratively with the plant operator. Process Network Parameter
   Metrics are pre-defined measurements from network traffic that may
   indicate that either process components are missing or there is
   additional traffic present that the process should not normally produce.
   After initial discussions with the plant operator, the network security

Abstract = {{Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems
   (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such
   as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and
   specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they
   often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost
   solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively
   polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could
   fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices
   (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be
   resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which
   are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these
   challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring
   approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors
   specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS,
   SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness
   of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity
   of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks
   at a rate of 99\%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of
   81-93\%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating
   few attack scenarios generating false negatives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hierarchical monitoring intrusion detection
   system (HAMIDS) for industrial control systems (ICS). The HAMIDS
   framework detects the anomalies in both level 0 and level 1 of an
   industrial control plant. In addition, the framework aggregates the
   cyber-physical process data in one point for further analysis as part of
   the intrusion detection process. The novelty of this framework is its
   ability to detect anomalies that have a distributed impact on the
   cyber-physical process. The performance of the proposed framework
   evaluated as part of SWaT security showdown (S3) in which six
   international teams were invited to test the framework in a real
   industrial control system. The proposed framework outperformed other
   proposed academic IDS in term of detection of ICS threats during the S3
   event, which was held from July 25-29, 2016 at Singapore University of
   Technology and Design.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with standard information technology systems, industrial
   control systems show more consistent and regular communications
   patterns. This characteristic contributes to the stability of controlled
   processes in critical infrastructures such as power plants, electric
   grids and water treatment facilities. However, Stuxnet has demonstrated
   that skilled attackers can strike critical infrastructures by leveraging
   knowledge about these processes. Sequence attacks subvert infrastructure
   operations by sending misplaced industrial control system messages. This
   chapter discusses four main sequence attack scenarios against industrial
   control systems. Real Modbus, Manufacturing Message Specification and
   IEC 60870-5-104 traffic samples were used to test sequencing and
   modeling techniques for describing industrial control system
   communications. The models were then evaluated to verify the feasibility
   of identifying sequence attacks. The results create the foundation for
   developing ``sequence-aware{''} intrusion detection systems.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and
   control physical processes associated with the critical infrastructure.
   Weaknesses in the application layer protocols, however, leave SCADA
   networks vulnerable to attack. In response, cyber security researchers
   have developed myriad intrusion detection systems. Researchers primarily
   rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traffic data
   sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads
   to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the
   results, cannot compare the effectiveness of different intrusion
   detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of
   intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks.
   Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to
   compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper
   describes four data sets, which include network traffic, process control
   and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two
   laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the MODBUS
   application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available,
   enable effective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems.}},
