Abstract = {{The usage of machine learning techniques is widely spread and has also
   been implemented in the wind industry in the last years. Many of these
   techniques have shown great success but need to constantly prove the
   expectation of functionality. This paper describes a new method to
   monitor the health of a wind turbine using an undercomplete autoencoder.
   To evaluate the health monitoring quality of the autoencoder, the number
   of anomalies before an event has happened are to be considered. The
   results show that around 35\% of all historical events that have
   resulted into a failure show many anomalies. Furthermore, the wind
   turbine subsystems which are subject to good detectability are the rotor
   system and the control system. If only one third of the service duties
   can be planned in advance, and thereby the scheduling time can be
   reduced, huge cost saving potentials can be seen.}},

   solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that
   encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation
   tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is
   focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the
   applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection and prevention system detects malicious activities
   that occur in the real-time SCADA systems. This system has a problem
   without a profound solution. The challenge of the existing intrusion
   detection is accuracy in the process of detecting the anomalies. In
   SCADA, wind turbine data are modified by the intruders and forged
   details are given to the server. To overcome this, the biased intrusion
   detection system is used for detecting the intrusion with encrypted
   date, time, and file location with less false-positive and
   false-negative rates and thereby preventing the SCADA system from
   further intrusion. It is done in three phases. First, Modified Grey Wolf
   Optimization (MGWO) is used to extract the features needed for
   classification and to find the best weight. Second, Entropy-based
   Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) is used to extort the features and
   detect the intruded data with its intruded time, file location, and
   date. Finally, the data are encrypted using the Hybrid Elliptical Curve
   Cryptography (HECC) to prevent further attack. Experimental results show
   better accuracy in both detection as well as prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Ice accretion on wind turbine blades is one of the major faults
   affecting the operational safety and power generation efficiency of wind
   turbines. Current icing detection methods are based on either
   meteorological observing system or extra condition monitoring system.
   Compared with current methods, icing detection using the intrinsic
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines
   has plenty of potential advantages, such as low cost, high stability,
   and early icing detection ability. However, there have not been deep
   investigations in this field at present. In this paper, a novel
   intelligent wind turbine blade icing detection method based on the wind
   turbine SCADA data is proposed. This method consists of three processes:
   SCADA data preprocessing, automatic feature extraction, and ensemble
   icing detection model construction. Specifically, deep autoencoders
   network is employed to learn multilevel fault features from the complex
   SCADA data adaptively. And the ensemble technique is utilized to make
   full use of all the extracted features from different hidden layers of
   the deep autoencoders network to build the ensemble icing detection
   model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the
   data collected from actual wind farms. The experimental results reveal
   that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively extract valuable
   fault features from the complex SCADA data, but also obtains higher
   detection accuracy and generalization capability compared with
   conventional machine learning models and individual deep learning model.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures crucial to our modern life, such as electricity
   grids and water pumps, are controlled by Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Over the last two decades, connecting
   critical infrastructures to the Internet has become essential due to
   performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet
   connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact
   that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic
   of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address
   these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection
   techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern
   recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data
   transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for
   anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that
   unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the
   system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov
   Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the
   algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature
   extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different
   aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern
   recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction,
   can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate
   functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Numerous intelligent fault diagnosis models have been developed on
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of wind
   turbines, so as to process massive SCADA data effectively and
   accurately. However, there is a problem ignored among these studies.
   That is, SCADA data distribution is imbalanced and the anomalous data
   mining is not sufficient. The amount of normal data is much more than
   that of abnormal data, which makes these models tend to be biased toward
   majority class, i.e., normal data, while accuracy of diagnosing fault is
   poor. Aimed at overcoming this problem, a novel intelligent fault
   diagnosis methodology is proposed based on exquisitely designed deep
   neural networks. The between-classes imbalance problem is handled by
   learning deep representation that can preserve within-class information
   and between-classes information based on triplet loss. The proposed
   method encourages a pair of data belonging to same class to be projected
   onto points as close as possible in new embedding space. It tries to
   enforce a margin between different class data. The effectiveness and
   generalization of the proposed method are validated on the SCADA data of
   two wind turbines containing blades icing accretion fault. The result
   demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the traditional normal
   behavior modeling method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems operate
   critical infrastructures in our modern society despite their
   vulnerability to attacks and misuse. There are several anomaly detection
   systems based on the cycles of polling mechanisms used in SCADA systems,
   but the feasibility of anomaly detection systems based on non-polling
   traffic, so called spontaneous events, is not well-studied. This paper
   presents a novel approach to modeling the timing characteristics of
   spontaneous events in an IEC-60870-5-104 network and exploits the model
   for anomaly detection. The system is tested with a dataset from a real
   power utility with injected timing effects from two attack scenarios.
   One attack causes timing anomalies due to persistent malfunctioning in
   the field devices, and the other generates intermittent anomalies caused
   by malware on the field devices, which is considered as stealthy. The
   detection accuracy and timing performance are promising for all the
   experiments with persistent anomalies. With intermittent anomalies, we
   found that our approach is effective for anomalies in low-volume traffic
   or attacks lasting over 1 hour.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are widely
   deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs) such as
   energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and
   computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have
   become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices
   and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network
   attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network
   protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network
   intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both
   conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of
   relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or
   flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and
   identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we
   design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack
   instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network
   models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using
   realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed
   deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion
   detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and
   providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.}},

Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal
   networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed
   and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems
   (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous
   years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in
   the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system
   (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against
   ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and
   critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks
   have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries.
   The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to
   deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is
   signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end,
   we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly
   detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model
   that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of
   communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups.
   First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale
   the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to
   improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited
   nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using
   the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system
   for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally,
   to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection
   with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly
   detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset
   generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed
   approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate
   of 97\%.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-attacks against Critical
   Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose,
   designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a
   significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks.
   Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine
   learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks.
   Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge,
   ``Curse of dimensionality{''}. This scenario accentuates the necessity
   of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it
   identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features
   without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel
   filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of
   informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based
   Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were
   carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of
   RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall,

   Data}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to the increasing installation of wind turbines in remote locations,
   both onshore and offshore, advanced fault detection and classification
   strategies have become crucial to accomplish the required levels of
   reliability and availability. In this work, without using specific
   tailored devices for condition monitoring but only increasing the
   sampling frequency in the already available (in all commercial wind
   turbines) sensors of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system, a data-driven multi-fault detection and classification
   strategy is developed. An advanced wind turbine benchmark is used. The
   wind turbine we consider is subject to different types of faults on
   actuators and sensors. The main challenges of the wind turbine fault
   detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and
   significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA
   measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature
   transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a
   new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal
   component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold
   cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is
   applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first
   choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some
   particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the
   detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in
   this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the
   selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed
   that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall
   accuracy of 98.2\%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed
   allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition
   monitoring in wind turbines.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In industrial disasters, early detection of problems and
   crisis management are critical for saving the lives of people and
   reducing the impact of disasters.
   Purpose: In this study, we design a special gateway system that bridges
   the gap between different communication protocols and enables legacy
   supervisory control and data acquisition systems to function early
   detection systems for potential industrial disasters.
   Methods: The system uses a new queue mechanism to substantially improve
   the problem of data loss found in conventional supervisory control and
   data acquisition systems and utilizes identification (ID) prioritization
   to enable early detection of problems. The proposed system is
   implemented and tested on a Linux-based, 3G-capable Modbus gateway
   system. Modbus is used as the communication protocol and 3G technology
   is utilized to provide high-speed wireless data transfer components. The
   Modbus gateway device uses an ARM-based EP9302 processor and has digital
   input/output, relay outputs, and RS485 outputs.
   Conclusion: This study is significant as it is the first work to show
   the application of the priority query execution method for Modbus
   gateway devices.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily
   increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and
   maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind
   turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health
   monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric
   machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The
   standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability
   distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC
   approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve.
   Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model
   to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw
   misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss
   of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important
   to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful
   case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
   and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be
   determined.}},

Title = {{Determination of optimal wind turbine alignment into the wind and

Abstract = {{Upwind horizontal axis wind turbines need to be aligned with the main
   wind direction to maximize energy yield. Attempts have been made to
   improve the yaw alignment with advanced measurement equipment but most
   of these techniques introduce additional costs and rely on alignment
   tolerances with the rotor axis or the true north.
   Turbines that are well aligned after commissioning may suffer an
   alignment degradation during their operational lifetime. Such changes
   need to be detected as soon as possible to minimize power losses. The
   objective of this paper is to propose a three-step methodology to
   improve turbine alignment and detect changes during operational lifetime
   with standard nacelle metrology (met) mast instruments (here: two cup
   anemometer and one wind vane).
   In step one, a reference turbine and an external undisturbed reference
   wind signal, e.g., met mast or lidar are used to determine flow
   corrections for the nacelle wind direction instruments to obtain a
   turbine alignment with optimal power production. Secondly a nacelle wind
   speed correction enables the application of the previous step without
   additional external measurement equipment. Step three is a monitoring
   application and allows the detection of alignment changes on the wind
   direction measurement device by means of a flow equilibrium between the
   two anemometers behind the rotor.
   The three steps are demonstrated at two 2 MW turbines together with a
   ground-based lidar. A first-order multilinear regression model gives
   sufficient correction of the flow distortion behind the rotor for our
   purposes and two wind vane alignment changes are detected with an
   accuracy of +/- 1.4 degrees within 3 days of operation after the change
   is introduced.
   We show that standard turbine equipment is able to align a turbine with
   sufficient accuracy and changes to its alignment can be detected in a
   reasonably short time, which helps to minimize power losses.}},

Abstract = {{Alarms affect operations in most part of the ship. Their impact on
   modern Engine Control Room operations is no less significant. The state
   of an alarm system serves as an indication of the extent to which the
   ship's operations are under management control. Thus, the design of
   efficient and reliable alarm monitoring system is vital for safe and
   sound operations. Although several design techniques have been proposed,
   all the proposed design methods employ sophisticated and expensive
   approaches in resolving alarm issues. In this paper, a cheap, yet
   reliable and efficient alarm design method for engine room device
   monitoring is presented. The design method employs PLCs and SCADA-based
   system and adopts certain basic design requirements of alarm monitoring
   system presented in literary works. Reasons for such a design method are
   highlighted, and the programming platforms for the design are given. The
   strengths and weaknesses of some design methods presented in some
   published works are reported and solutions to such problems are
   proposed. The proposed design technique, including fault diagnostic
   algorithm, have been subjected to real-time online testing at the
   shipyard, specifically Changjiang Waterway Bureau, China (ship name-Ning
   Dao 501). The testing results proved that this design technique is
   reliable, efficient and effective for online engine control room device
   monitoring.}},

   performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data
   trends have nonlinear characteristics. The method is tested using two

Abstract = {{Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring.
   Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious
   intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to
   the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA
   protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect
   attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in
   this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in
   SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system
   and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution
   of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for
   missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2)
   The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)
   are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score for
   intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and
   categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect
   intrusions effectively, with an F-1 score of respectively > 99\%.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical
   role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems.
   There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events
   or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to
   catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a
   preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to
   its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be
   generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most
   existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one
   or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about
   attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel
   edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks
   named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data
   and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct
   characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized
   before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is
   built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it.}},

   There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion
   detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control
   system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the
   application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in
   detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have
   applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later,
   compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in
   the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA
   security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the
   malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network
   traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based
   protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate
   the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack
   which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack
   on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the
   attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental
   results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks
   within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition system is an important part of
   the country's critical infrastructure, but its inherent network
   characteristics are vulnerable to attack by intruders. The vulnerability
   of supervisory control and data acquisition system was analyzed,
   combining common attacks such as information scanning, response
   injection, command injection and denial of service in industrial control
   systems, and proposed an intrusion detection model based on graphical
   features. The time series of message transmission were visualized,
   extracting the vertex coordinates and various graphic area features to
   constitute a new data set, and obtained classification model of
   intrusion detection through training. An intrusion detection experiment
   environment was built using tools such as MATLAB and power protocol
   testers. IEC 60870-5-104 protocol which is widely used in power systems
   had been taken as an example. The results of tests have good

Abstract = {{This paper presents an anomaly detection approach using machine learning
   to achieve condition monitoring for wind turbines. The approach applies
   the information in supervisory control and data acquisition systems as
   data input. First, machine learning is used to estimate the temperature

   deviations between the estimated values and the measurements of the
   signals. Finally, the information of alarm logs is integrated with the
   previous analysis to determine the operation states of wind turbines.
   The proposed approach has been tested with the data experience of a 2MW
   wind turbine in Sweden. The result demonstrates that the approach can
   detect possible anomalies before the failure occurrence. It also
   certifies that the approach can remind operators of the possible changes
   inside wind turbines even when the alarm logs do not report any alarms.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines are, generally, placed at remote locations and are subject
   to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes.
   Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair
   and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management
   using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the
   reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them
   more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for
   maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind
   turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a
   condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a
   wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation
   and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of
   age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical
   model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval
   Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance
   optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate
   models. The application of the maintenance management framework is
   demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Consequently, SCADA systems face different sophisticated types of cyber

   Intrusion Detection System (PRI-IDS) technique based on analysing
   network traffic of Modbus TCP/IP for identifying replay attacks. It is
   acknowledged that Modbus TCP is usually vulnerable due to its
   unauthenticated and unencrypted nature. Our technique is evaluated using
   a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a custom
   SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is
   exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an
   attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave. The
   experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique can
   effectively and efficiently recognise replay attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Belt conveyor system is a crucial element of ore transport process in
   underground copper ore mine. Damage of single belt conveyor might cause
   stopping of huge part of underground transport network, especially when
   failure concerns the main haulage conveyor line. For that reason it is
   important to use SCADA monitoring system. The symptom of damage can be
   found in increasing temperature measured within the system.
   Unfortunately, operating belt conveyors can be considered as
   time-varying system and direct decision making using temperature value
   is difficult. Long-term analysis of time series enables to learn how to
   recognize alarming moment. Thus the removal of failure can be scheduled
   so as to minimize the losses in production. In this paper the clustering
   method was applied to the long-term observations of the temperature in
   order to gearbox fault detection. Moreover, the breaks in the activity
   of belt conveyors (no operation) caused by holidays will be determined.
   The clustering algorithm identifies also the specific character of the
   work at the beginning and end of week.}},

Abstract = {{Intentional attacks(1) that cause country wide blackouts, gas and water
   systems malfunction are actions that can be carried out by a nation to
   impact on another nation in a mean of war. Supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) networks that allow for communication for the
   utilities companies were designed with no security in mind causing the
   systems that a nation relies on to fall vulnerable to exploitation.
   Since SCADA networks are static in nature with pre-defined signatures of
   network traffic, we propose to design an anomaly-based intrusion
   detection system to detect abnormality in SCADA network traffic and
   protocols. We gather normal SCADA network traffic via tapping on the
   network for 30 days and then attack the network using Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack, message spoofing attack and man-in-the middle attack. We
   then train a classifier with two classes, normal and abnormal and report
   the classifier accuracy in detecting abnormal SCADA network traffic.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used
   in many applications including power transmission and distribution for
   situational awareness and control. Identifying and detecting intrusions
   in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this
   purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the
   existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false
   positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date
   and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to
   overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo
   Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based
   Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main
   intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a
   SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network
   dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the
   clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the
   best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the
   intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA
   algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the
   proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall,
   accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems complexity and
   interconnectivity increase in recent years have exposed the SCADA
   networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have
   shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves
   improved performance to identify unknown or zero-day attacks. In this
   paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection
   in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we
   present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in
   SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for
   anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing
   redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset
   can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models
   were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at
   the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State
   University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our
   proposed model has a key effect in reducing the time and computational
   complexity and achieved improved accuracy and detection rate. The
   accuracy of our proposed model was measured as 99.5 \% for

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the
   absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of
   intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data
   using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
   The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial
   control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult
   task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital
   systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in
   order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious
   activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection,
   sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a
   new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on
   the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering
   mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing
   intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system
   datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting
   suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three
   techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness
   of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating
   cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time
   state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian
   noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on
   both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce
   particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To
   solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection
   and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual
   generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first
   generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using
   statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The
   proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several
   attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its
   statistical performance is also compared with several conventional
   quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the
   transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed
   criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed
   detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and
   false isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital
   targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data.
   The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems
   in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers
   and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The
   Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most
   accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS.
   However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number
   of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data
   and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we
   introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to
   improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and
   to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the
   following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces
   the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves
   the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\%
   using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively.}},

Abstract = {{European Starlings and other bird's flocks in thousands and even
   millions. Their flocking behaviors attract predators that see such
   collective behavior as an easy target. However, the surprising thing is
   that it is harder to target and capture one in their mist than a lone
   bird. It is easy to target and capture a lone bird than a bird in a
   flock. One of these collective behaviors is the capability of each of
   them to detect a predator. Each one in the flock can detect a predator
   some meters away. The more they are in number, the harder it will be not
   to detect the incoming predator. This paper proposed modelling the same
   approach for securing Industrial Control System (ICS) and in particular
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, this approach
   seen in the flock of birds can be replicated in computer system for
   securing it. Train system was used as a testbed in this paper for data
   collection. Live data from the train system was collected, analyzed and
   some risk points were discovered. This risk points were the entry points
   for anomalies into the system. These are the points that needs securing.
   The model was to show the viability of using the approach as well as
   integrating it on SCADA systems, and the train system was a
   representation of SCADA system. This approach is purely distributed in
   the sense that each bird is capable of detecting a predator. The
   detection of anomalies is based on the location of each bird in the
   system. The bird's environment has cells and each cell has number. The
   maximum number of birds each cell can contain was six. Six birds
   approach was used for the detection and this can be seen in the model.
   Whenever a packet arrives, the first cell that contain six birds will be
   activated for detection. Birds in the cell has numbers and the activity
   is based on the number. The results showed that both known and unknow
   anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
   networks control critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear

   target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with
   successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and
   injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced
   tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a
   number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we
   study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source
   intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS,
   Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats
   against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control
   protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the
   performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its

Abstract = {{SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that
   allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In
   the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information
   bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units;
   however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as
   internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give
   more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible
   cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These
   attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a
   country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system
   for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on
   SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning
   techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control
   devices. A support vector of type ``Class One{''} machine and a test
   lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{State of power system is often determined by taking simultaneous
   measurements across the grid. However, in developing countries with
   geographically expansive grid, if the measurements are not GPS
   timestamped there are latencies owing to distance of sensor from control
   center or communication system performance. The latency and resulting
   time-skews in data fed as input to state estimator program may either be

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) databases have three
   main features that identify them as big data systems: volume, variety
   and velocity. SCADAs are extremely important for the safety and secure
   operation of modern power system and provide essential online
   information about the power system state to system operators. A current
   research challenge is to efficiently process this big data, which
   involves real-time measurements of hundreds of thousands of
   heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the
   foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most
   important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others
   data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing
   with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high
   as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these
   restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data
   that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier
   detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a
   Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed
   methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important
   events that affect the system.}},

Abstract = {{Certain mechanical and electrical components, such as generators,
   exhibit degradation phenomena, which may develop slowly over time or
   suddenly. The current trend in this field of research is to develop
   malfunction detection indicators from analog signals recorded by
   operation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), creating
   behavioral models of the equipment and the development of a series of
   status indicators. These models and indicators are used to detect
   malfunctions when operation SCADA are unable to detect an abnormality,
   thus determining that the component is beginning to degrade when certain
   normal limits are exceeded. However, the digital signals from operation
   SCADA have great potential for providing additional information that
   could be used to detect possible malfunction. Detection must be
   accompanied by a study of the remaining life of a component so that the
   remaining useful life of the component before failure can be estimated
   before losing its functionality. If SCADA can detect a malfunction and
   determine when the component will break, the operator will have valuable
   time to intervene prior to failure at an optimum time. This is
   particularly important in installations with difficult access, such as
   offshore wind farms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by
   the electric utility industry to monitor and control electric power
   generation, transmission and distribution are recognized today as
   critical components of the electric power delivery infrastructure. SCADA
   systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely
   distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection
   mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great
   importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This
   defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate,
   since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the
   intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated
   detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed
   in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system
   (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an
   intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the
   integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations
   based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work, an early fault detection system for the generator cooling
   of wind turbines is presented and tested. It relies on a hybrid model of
   the cooling system. The parameters of the generator model are estimated
   by an extended Kalman filter. The estimated parameters are then
   processed by an appropriate statistical change detection algorithm in
   order to detect faults in the cooling system. To validate the method, it
   has been tested on 3years of historical data from 43 turbines. During
   the testing period, 16 faults occurred; 15 of these were detected by the
   developed method, and one false alarm was issued. This is an improvement
   compared with the current system that gives 15 detections and more than
   10 false alarms. In some cases, the method detects the fault a long time
   before the turbine reports an alarm. A further advantage of the method
   is that it is based on supervisory control and data acquisition data
   that are available for the operator of all modern turbines. Thereby, the
   method can be implemented without the need to modify or install
   additional components in the turbines. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

   on multiplexed cyclic traffic when the individual cyclic patterns are
   known. The challenge is to construct the Statechart, by unsupervised
   learning, from a captured trace of the multiplexed traffic, especially
   when the same symbols (ICS messages) can appear in multiple cycles, or
   multiple times in a cycle. Previously we suggested a combinatorial
   approach for the Statechart construction, based on Euler cycles in the
   Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) graph of the trace. This combinatorial
   approach worked well in simple scenarios, but produced a false-alarm
   rate that was excessive on more complex multiplexed traffic.
   In this paper we suggest a new Statechart construction method, based on
   spectral analysis. We use the Fourier transform to identify the dominant
   periods in the trace. Our algorithm then associates a set of symbols
   with each dominant period, identifies the order of the symbols within
   each period, and creates the cyclic DFAs and the Statechart.
   We evaluated our solution on long traces from two production ICS: one
   using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol and the other using Modbus. We also
   stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated
   traces that simulate multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of
   symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The resulting Statecharts model the
   traces with an overall median false-alarm rate as low as 0.16\% on the
   synthetic datasets, and with zero false-alarms on production S7-0x72
   traffic. Moreover, the spectral analysis Statecharts consistently
   out-performed the previous combinatorial Statecharts, exhibiting
   significantly lower false alarm rates and more compact model sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often
   initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying
   sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical
   damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against
   cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in
   detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For
   this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference
   implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect
   attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order
   to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset
   created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State
   University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and
   cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance
   metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall;
   accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate
   may change significantly when considering various attack types and
   different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also
   provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably
   real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical
   infrastructures.}},

Abstract = {{Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they
   control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including
   electric power, oil \& gas and others. The protocols used in this domain
   were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much
   consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today
   have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks,
   leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the
   physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to
   improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are
   typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended
   with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is
   its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial
   support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on
   existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic
   rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple
   language grammar allows network engineers to describe system
   characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of
   the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with
   SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates
   network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS.
   An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system
   changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital
   component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in
   SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking
   mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when
   increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the
   system security, but few of them can effectively resist response
   injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper
   we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the
   periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical
   SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in
   SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing
   an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect
   response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the
   network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered
   simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection,
   especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed
   system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching
   severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is
   polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of our IDS mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of networks within an organization made many critical
   infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that
   were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet.
   CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more
   sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore
   it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them,
   thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To
   specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we
   propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the
   intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could
   be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known
   vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be
   identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning
   component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and
   correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the
   specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then
   security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable
   configurations on critical infrastructure network devices.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA traffic between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the
   Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be highly periodic.
   However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling.
   Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed SCADA streams using
   Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically
   produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. In this paper we
   introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our
   Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern,
   together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic
   into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We evaluated
   our solution on traces from a production SCADA system using the Siemens

   need for methods of condition monitoring and predictive maintenance.
   During the last years, the number of techniques using 10 min SCADA data

   Nevertheless, the non-stationary operating condition of wind turbines is
   still an issue. This paper will present a new approach using the

   more classical approach using data coming from a single turbine will be
   tested on two different generator failures to compare the results.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine failure and downtime can often compromise the profitability
   of a wind farm due to their high impact on the operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) costs. Early detection of failures can facilitate the changeover
   from corrective maintenance towards a predictive approach. This paper
   presents a cost-effective methodology to combine various alarm analysis
   techniques, using data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system, in order to detect component failures. The approach
   categorises the alarms according to a reviewed taxonomy, turning
   overwhelming data into valuable information to assess component status.
   Then, different alarms analysis techniques are applied for two purposes:
   the evaluation of the SCADA alarm system capability to detect failures,
   and the investigation of the relation between components faults being
   followed by failure occurrences in others. Various case studies are
   presented and discussed. The study highlights the relationship between
   faulty behaviour in different components and between failures and
   adverse environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel domain-aware anomaly detection system that
   detects irregular changes in Modbus/TCP SCADA control register values.
   The research discovered the presence of three classes of registers: (i)
   sensor registers; (ii) counter registers; and (iii) constant registers.
   An automatic classifier was developed to identify these classes.
   Additionally, parameterized behavior models were created for each class.
   During its learning phase, the anomaly detection system used the
   classifier to identify the different types of registers and instantiated
   the model for each register based on its type. During the enforcement
   phase, the system detected deviations from the model. The anomaly
   detection system was evaluated using 131 h of traffic from a production
   SCADA system. The classifier had a true positive classification rate of
   93\%. During the enforcement phase, a 0.86\% false alarm rate was
   obtained for the correctly-classified registers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Energy theft has been a serious and long existing problem facing by many
   power utilities. The implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure
   (AMI) provides power companies with new means for energy theft
   detection. As fundamental equipment of AMI, smart meters collect
   interval measurements from customer sites and thus provide system wide
   visibility for power companies. Leveraging both AMI and SCADA
   measurements, this paper puts forward an integrated distribution state
   estimation method for medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution
   network. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can achieve a
   higher accuracy level for estimation. Furthermore, an energy theft
   detection method is proposed based on ``weight-dropped polling{''}
   integrated distribution state estimation. Simulations show that it can
   deliver promising results comparing with conventional state estimation

Abstract = {{A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is an
   Industrial Control System (ICS) which controls large scale industrial
   processes including several sites over long distances and consists of
   some Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and a Master Terminal Unit (MTU). RTUs
   collect data from sensors and control actuators situated at remote sites
   and send data to the MTU through a network. Since RTUs operate in a
   harsh industrial environment, fault tolerance is a key requirement
   particularly for safety-critical industrial processes. Studies show that
   a significant number of transient faults due to a harsh environment
   result in control flow errors in the RTU's processors. A software error
   detection technique has been proposed to detect control flow errors in
   several RTUs. For experimental evaluation 30,000 faults injected on
   network; the average performance and memory overheads are about 33.20 \%
   and 36.79 \%, respectively and this technique detected more than 96.32
   \% of injected faults.}},

Abstract = {{ICS (Industrial Control System) is a computer-controlled system that
   monitors and controls distributed field devices for power grid, water
   treatment and other industrial areas. Because ICS components fulfill
   their own roles, the network traffic of ICS has obvious regular
   patterns. These patterns can be used effectively in monitoring ICS
   network and detecting signs of cyber-attacks. In our previous work, we
   proposed a burst-based anomaly detection method for DNP3 protocol using
   the regularity of ICS network traffic. Traffic monitoring method such as
   switch mirroring causes many problems; packet duplication, packet
   out-of-order, and packet loss. The problems cause many false alarms.
   Furthermore, it is hard to decide whether the alarms caused by lost
   packets are true or false. In this paper, we apply our burst-based
   approach to TCP protocol in SCADA network and propose a method to manage
   monitoring problems for burst-based anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric
   grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application
   areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised
   concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition
   (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming
   needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which
   are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some
   disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the
   intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an
   integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel ``What-if{''}
   module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal.
   This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the
   system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer
   and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually
   clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these
   work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the
   proposed `` What-if{''} module.}},

   the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is
   impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks.
   A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in
   the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack
   scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power
   systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed
   consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal
   Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI)
   etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial
   communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3.The proposed
   testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting
   potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to
   send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from
   the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in
   reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher
   security measures.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in real-time systems is a problem without a profound
   solution. In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
   the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of
   intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes
   regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system.
   An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is
   distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion
   detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and
   the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits
   traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of
   OCSVM models. These trained models run in parallel and can accurately
   and fast recognise different types of attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The massive use of information and communication technologies in
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways
   for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying
   on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the
   heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for
   traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has
   become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very
   severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious
   intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and
   firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for
   intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification
   algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated:
   1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel
   principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is
   examined in detail with the study of l(p)-norms in radial basis function
   (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the
   bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data
   with several types of cyberattacks.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a core part
   of industrial systems, such as smart grid power and water distribution
   systems. In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber
   attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly
   detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the
   development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to
   counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an
   automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA
   data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity
   detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase,
   the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is
   adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal
   inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from
   consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known
   fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract
   proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative
   data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training
   data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as
   simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide
   significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared
   to three well-known anomaly detection approaches. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are
   designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with
   other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last
   years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to
   attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its
   normal operation.
   In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of
   detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support
   Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering.
   The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the
   proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from
   possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters sigma and v,
   making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA
   systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off
   line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of
   an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI
   project.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber threats in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems have the potential to render physical damage and jeopardize
   power system operation, safety and stability. SCADA systems were
   originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber
   threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion
   detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an
   emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
   method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC
   60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol
   communications. The proposed stateful protocol analysis approach is
   presented that is designed specifically for the IEC 60870-5-104
   protocol. Finally, the novel intrusion detection approach are

Abstract = {{SCADA systems are broadly employed in supervising and controlling

   The security of SCADA systems represents a significant subject on

   vital utility services. In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access
   to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason
   that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce
   interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the

Abstract = {{Advanced false data injection attack in targeted malware intrusion is
   becoming an emerging severe threat to the Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) system. Several intrusion detection schemes have
   been proposed previously {[}1, 2]. However, designing an effective
   real-time detection system for a resource-constraint device is still an
   open problem for the research community. In this paper, we propose a new
   relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection
   attacks at the SCADA system, even when injected data may seemly fall
   within a valid/normal range. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we
   design a novel detection model, alternation vectors with state relation
   graph. Furthermore, we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the
   injection point(s), i.e., the attack origin, in the system. We evaluate
   SRID with a real-world power plant simulator. The experiment results
   show that SRID can detect various false data injection attacks with a
   low false positive rate at 0.0125\%. Meanwhile, SRID can dramatically
   reduce the search space of attack origins and accurately locate most of
   attack origins.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of
   attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal
   pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential
   observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate
   model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one
   fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the
   observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix
   inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme
   is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized
   fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator
   faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our
   particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the
   attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis
   reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting
   physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also
   comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of
   detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a
   successful deception attack.}},

Abstract = {{The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for
   communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable
   logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion
   detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The
   approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from
   a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can
   be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An
   algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA
   associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages.
   The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into
   Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This
   approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a
   message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a
   message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection
   approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high
   sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect
   matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven
   PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111 h of operation.
   Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real
   anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the
   HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured
   incorrectly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of electrical control system faults leads to increased
   mechanical component degradation, severe reduction of asset performance,
   and a direct increase in annual maintenance costs. This paper presents a
   highly accurate data driven classification system for the diagnosis of
   electrical control system faults, in particular, wind turbine pitch
   faults. Early diagnosis of these faults can enable operators to move
   from traditional corrective or time based maintenance towards a
   predictive maintenance strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks
   and requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach provides
   transparent, human-readable rules for maintenance operators which have
   been validated by an independent domain expert. Data from 8 wind
   turbines was collected every 10 min over a period of 28 months with 10
   attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Three fault classes are
   identified, each represented by 6,000 instances in each of the testing
   and training sets. Of the turbines, 4 are used to train the system with
   a further 4 for validation. Repeated random sampling of the majority
   fault class was used to reduce computational overheads whilst retaining
   information content and balancing the training and validation sets. A
   classification accuracy of 85.50 \% was achieved with 14 human readable
   rules generated via the RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these, 11 were
   described as ``useful and intuitive{''} by an independent domain-expert.
   An expert system was developed utilising the model along with domain
   knowledge, resulting in a pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05 \%
   along with a 42.12 \% reduction in pitch fault alarms.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient
   part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as
   electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution,
   and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their
   connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e. g.
   TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these
   systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in
   these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking
   authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are
   potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with
   unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because
   labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly
   and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms
   suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that
   can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to
   improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework
   demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion
   detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means
   greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy
   communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security
   vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little
   consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of
   SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes
   signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems.
   The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known
   suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is
   proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally,
   proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are
   implemented and verified via Snort rules.}},

Abstract = {{In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and
   networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of
   closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against
   cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and
   communication/network protocols, and their private networks are
   physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However,
   in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its
   maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure
   against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of
   m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for
   detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion
   detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which
   has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is
   dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with
   pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set
   can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold
   values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference
   model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model
   can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their
   overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance
   cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous
   monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection
   algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs
   by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by
   eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory
   Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring
   system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is
   a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of
   failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our
   exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault
   detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number
   of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated
   classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal
   components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures
   due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original
   measurements including rotor speeds and produced power.}},

Abstract = {{Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and
   deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small
   amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic
   controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data
   within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system
   failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion
   Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational
   behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm
   filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are
   required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity
   when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks
   are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and
   simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with
   and without the TFIDS.}},

   SCADA systems have a number of peculiarities that make anomaly detection

   applicability to wind turbine fault identification. It explains how the
   anomaly-detection techniques have been adopted to analyse supervisory
   control and data acquisition data acquired from a wind farm, automating
   and simplifying the operators' analysis task by interpreting the volume
   of data available. The techniques are brought together into one system
   to collate their output and provide a single decision support
   environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent
   system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the
   output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the
   accuracy of fault detection. The results presented demonstrate that the
   interpretation techniques can provide performance assessment and early
   fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to
   make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their

Abstract = {{Current Intrusion Detection System (IDS) technology is not suited to be
   widely deployed inside a Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) environment. Anomaly- and signature-based IDS technologies have
   developed methods to cover information technology-based networks
   activity and protocols effectively. However, these IDS technologies do
   not include the fine protocol granularity required to ensure network
   security inside an environment with weak protocols lacking
   authentication and encryption. By implementing a more specific and more
   intelligent packet inspection mechanism, tailored traffic flow analysis,
   and unique packet tampering detection, IDS technology developed
   specifically for SCADA environments can be deployed with confidence in
   detecting malicious activity.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical industries which are intended for the packaging of
   different tablets in a strip of blister need to make sure that the
   tablets are free from defects before letting them go into the packing
   box. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient, reliable
   and cost effective Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   System for detection and removing of unwanted tablet(s) strips. The
   system detects defective tablets by capturing image of a batch of
   tablets and performs morphological analysis over it. If a defective
   tablet is found, the system is smart enough to trace in which strip the
   defective tablet would be present after cutting of batch and hence
   instructing the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) to remove that strip. The
   status of the whole process at the completion of every order is sent to
   Master Terminal Unit (MTU) which generates and saves the log rile on
   MS-EXCEL, and is also able to send the log rile to main server via
   Electronic Mail.}},

Abstract = {{Pointer taintedness is a concept which has been successfully employed as
   basis for vulnerability analysis of C/C++ source code, and as a run-time
   mitigation technique against memory corruption attacks. Nevertheless,
   pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several
   industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable
   in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of
   those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis
   may have no visibility on certain lowlevel vulnerabilities since there
   may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with
   the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of
   memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of
   industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are
   related to a dynamic organization of data in memory.
   In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access
   taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of
   memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness
   is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of
   implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main
   low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks
   specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of
   memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities.
   We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as
   the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for
   the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities
   in implementations of industrial control protocols.}},
