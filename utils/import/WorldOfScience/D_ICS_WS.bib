Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of industrial control systems and the diversity of
   protocols in networks, it is difficult to build intrusion detection
   models based on network characteristics and physical modeling. In order
   to build a better flow model without additional knowledge, we propose an
   intrusion detection method based on the content of network packets. The
   construction of the model is based on the idea of ZOE method. The
   similarity between flows is calculated through the sequential coverage
   algorithm, the normal flow model is established by multi-layered
   clustering algorithm, and the Count-Mean-Min Sketch is used to store and
   count the flow model. By comparing the unknown flow with the constructed
   normal flow model, we achieve the intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS). The overall experimental results on 4 ICS datasets
   show that the improved method can effectively improve the detection rate
   and reduce the false-positive rate. The detection rate reached 96.7\% on
   average, and the false-positive rate reached 0.7\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the industrial control system (ICS) plays a vital role in
   critical infrastructures like the power grid. However, there is an
   increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to
   malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack
   would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this
   paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to
   mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take
   advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets
   include register status values that are used to reflect the physical
   characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states
   to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial
   networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register
   state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite
   automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS
   attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device
   fingerprints, including passive and active detection. We present a
   prototype of the iFinger and conduct real-world experiments to validate
   its performance. Results show that our approach achieves 97.1\% F1 score
   in ICS device identification. Furthermore, we simulate two typical ICS
   attacks (replacement and code modification) to validate the
   effectiveness of our iFinger in industrial networks. Our device
   fingerprints would detect those malicious attacks within 2s latency at
   98.0\% recall.}},

Title = {{Accelerating Electromigration Aging: Fast Failure Detection for

Abstract = {{For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced
   failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is
   creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively
   under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and
   validation can be carried out efficiently. Existing acceleration
   techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities
   beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects
   making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In
   this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to
   address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment
   interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to
   significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this
   observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced
   failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced
   acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and
   sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect
   structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM
   testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and
   can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of
   some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be
   carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower
   temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most
   significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is
   the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled
   environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that
   are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The
   simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce
   the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about
   10(5)x acceleration) under the 150 degrees C temperature limit, which is
   sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a prevailing area of research for several years,
   and numerous intrusion detection systems have been proposed for
   industrial control systems (ICS). In recent ages, the attacks like
   seismic net, duqu and flame against ICS infrastructures have instigated
   great harm to nuclear infrastructures and precarious facilities in
   several nations. The authors outline an approach to detect
   intrusions/anomalies in K'S. A method is presented to detect intrusions
   in real-time and automatically. The existing techniques are normally
   designed for open systems and protocols, that lacks adequate
   generalisation and resistance to acclimate to other networks, and they
   have either short detection rote or tall rate of false positive. This
   Letter presents a network packet contents behaviour and bidirectional
   Gated Recurrent Units-based method to detect intrusions in a timely and
   efficient manner. The method has proven a robust method of classifying
   intmsions/anomalies in a proficient way. Through extensive evaluation on
   an actual huge scale dataset spawned from SCADA-based gas pipeline
   network, the proposed method shows significant performance enhancement
   and outclasses the standard state-of-the-art methods with 98.68\% rate

Title = {{Multivariate Abnormal Detection for Industrial Control Systems Using 1D
   CNN and GRU}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{88348-88359}},
Abstract = {{Currently, most anomaly detection approaches in industrial control
   systems (ICSs) use network event logs to build models, and current
   unsupervised machine learning methods rarely use spatiotemporal
   correlations and other dependencies between multiple variables
   (sensors/actuators) in a system to detect anomalies. Most of the
   existing anomaly detection technologies simply compare the current
   states with the predicted normal range. Due to the highly dynamic
   characteristic of industrial control systems, it is insufficient to
   simply compare the current states with the predicted normal range. As a
   result, these approaches have low detection rates for unknown or new
   types of attacks. In view of these shortcomings, this paper presents a
   network model for predicting sensor/controller parameters in industrial
   control systems. To predict the parameter values of the sensors and
   controllers more accurately, the 1D convolutional neural network (1D \&
   x005F;CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are combined to fully learn
   the spatiotemporal correlation and other dependencies between the
   parameter values of the sensors and controllers at each moment. An
   abnormal state detection method based on the calculation of the
   statistical deviation is proposed to realize the anomaly detection of
   industrial control systems. The model is validated on the Secure Water
   Treatment (SWaT) dataset. The precision, recall and F1 scores are used
   to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in anomaly detection on the
   SWaT dataset. The experimental results show that the average precision
   and recall of this method are 0.99 and 0.85, respectively, and that the
   average F1 score is 0.91. The experimental results show that the
   proposed method can be successfully applied to anomaly detection systems
   in industrial control systems with lower false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{The cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs) is becoming
   increasingly critical under the current advancement in the cyber
   activity and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and their direct
   impact on several life aspects such as safety, economy, and security.
   This paper presents a novel semi-supervised dual isolation forests-based
   (DIF) attack detection system that has been developed using the normal
   process operation data only and is demonstrated on a scale-down ICS
   known as the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed and the Water
   Distribution (WADI) testbed. The proposed cyber-attack detection
   framework is composed of two isolation forest models that are trained
   independently using the normalized raw data and a pre-processed version
   of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), respectively, to
   detect attacks by separating-away anomalies. The performance of the
   proposed method is compared with the previous works, and it demonstrates
   improvements in terms of the attack detection capability, computational
   requirements, and applicability to high dimensional systems.}},

Abstract = {{To improve productivity and efficiency in industrial manufacturing, the
   fourth industrial revolution leads to the implementation of Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) in the industrial
   environment. Ubiquitous communication makes CPS susceptible to external
   influences, which can have a negative intention; for instance, CPS are
   prone to various attacks and malicious threats by different adversaries.
   The impact of an attack on the system can lead to anomalies and serious
   consequences for system parts or the system as a whole. Security
   mechanisms must be developed in order to timely detect different attacks
   and to keep the system safe and protected. In this paper, a method for
   sensor signal attacks detection in a continuous time controlled systems
   has been proposed. The method is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   and tested on the data obtained from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)
   testbed, a scaled-down plant that produces purified water.}},

Title = {{A Two Stage Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Control Networks
   Based on Ethernet/IP}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 and the TCP/IP protocol suite) is
   gradually applied in industrial control system (ICS) with the
   development of information technology. It breaks the natural isolation
   of ICS, but contains no security mechanisms. An improved intrusion
   detection system (IDS), which is strongly correlated to specific
   industrial scenarios, is necessary for modern ICS. On one hand, this
   paper outlines three kinds of attack models, including infiltration
   attacks, creative forging attacks, and false data injection attacks. On
   the other hand, a two stage IDS is proposed, which contains a traffic
   prediction model and an anomaly detection model. The traffic prediction
   model, which is based on the autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA), can forecast the traffic of the ICS network in the short term
   and detect infiltration attacks precisely according to the abnormal
   changes in traffic patterns. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model,
   using a one class support vector machine (OCSVM), is able to detect
   malicious control instructions by analyzing the key field in Ethernet/IP
   packets. The confusion matrix is selected to testify to the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and two other innovative IDSs are
   used for comparison. The experiment results show that the proposed two
   stage IDS in this paper has an outstanding performance in detecting
   infiltration attacks, forging attacks, and false data injection attacks
   compared with other IDSs.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted
   integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan
   detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is
   masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome
   the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based
   on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the
   different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed
   Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are
   used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random
   side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by
   the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the
   suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the
   embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about
   250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by
   using the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of attacks against cyberphysical systems in recent
   years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control
   systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly
   based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion
   prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from
   motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack
   detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed
   utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process
   parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense
   in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable
   consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for
   demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS
   testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of
   service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data
   injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack
   and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four
   classical classification models based on network data and host system
   data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree,
   bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a
   secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that
   the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results
   suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm
   rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable
   detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be
   detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command
   tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored
   for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed
   detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied
   to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this
   approach detects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant
   consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack
   detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a
   promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.}},

Abstract = {{Most of prior hardware Trojan detection approaches require golden chips
   for references. A classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan
   detection technique has been proposed in the authors' previous work.
   However, the algorithm in that work is trained by simulated ICs without
   considering a shift between the simulation and silicon fabrication. In
   this study, a co-training based hardware Trojan detection method by
   exploiting inaccurate simulation models and unlabeled fabricated ICs is
   proposed to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated
   ICs, which eliminates the need of golden chips. Two classification
   algorithms are trained using simulated ICs. These two algorithms can
   identify different patterns in the unlabelled ICs during test-time, and
   thus can label some of these ICs for the further training of the other
   algorithm. Moreover, a statistical examination is used to choose ICs
   labelling for the other algorithm. A statistical confidence interval
   based technique is also used to combine the hypotheses of the two
   classification algorithms. Furthermore, the partial least squares method
   is used to preprocess the raw data of ICs for feature selection. Both
   EDA experiment results and field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   experiment results show that the proposed technique can detect unknown
   Trojans with high accuracy and recall.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of industrial control systems (ICSs), a broad application
   background and the different characteristics of a system determine the
   diversity and particularity of an intrusion detection system. We propose
   an abnormal detection method based on a behavior model. The method
   extracts behavior data sequences from industrial control network
   traffic, builds a normal behavior model of the controller and the
   controlled process of an ICS, and compares tested behavior data and
   prediction behavior data to detect any exceptions. According to
   experimental results, our method can effectively detect abnormal
   behavior data and control program manipulation attacks. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) constitute complex and
   heterogeneous `system of systems' embracing the numerous advantages of
   traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The
   pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS
   broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised
   new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical
   attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place,
   unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability,
   that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a
   salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS.
   We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS
   under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined
   Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based
   communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the
   communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and
   localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an
   optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and
   security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present
   intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test
   infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution's
   applicability to networked robot control systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{To reduce the excessive power consumption and eliminate the battery
   voltage imbalance caused in conventional method, a novel broken line
   detection scheme for Li-ion battery protection integrated circuits (ICs)
   is presented in this study. The main part of the proposed circuit
   consists of pull-up, pull-down current source, source-driven MOS, a
   control switch and a bias current source. A narrow pulse control signal
   is adopted to trigger broken line detection periodically so as to
   suppress the detection current consumption, while the disadvantage of
   battery voltage imbalance is overcome. The proposed circuit has been
   implemented in a seven cells Li-ion battery protection IC with 0.18 mu m
   45 V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process successfully. The experimental results
   confirm that the chip can reliably detect the disconnections of Li-ion
   batteries and take protective measures in a wide cell voltage range from
   2.2 to 4.2 V. Furthermore, based on the derivation in this study, the
   proposed technique can significantly reduce the detection current
   consumption of each cell, which is well beneficial for low power
   consumption and battery voltage balance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection
   against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits
   (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly
   published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the
   electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip
   area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that
   is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in
   one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out
   in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving
   the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the
   measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept
   implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs
   under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the
   user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab
   equipment in short amount of time.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing interaction of modern industrial control systems (ICS) to
   the outside Internet world influences making these systems vulnerable to
   a wide range of cyber-attacks. Moreover, the utilisation of
   Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products, as well as open communication
   protocols, made them attractive targets to various threat agents
   including cyber-criminals, national-state, and cyber-terrorists. Given
   that, today's ICSs are deriving the most critical national
   infrastructures. Therefore, this raises tremendous needs to secure these
   systems against cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology has been
   considered as one of the most essential security precautions for ICS
   networks. It can effectively detect potential cyber-attacks and

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems are found often in industrial sectors and
   critical infrastructures to monitor and control industrial processes.
   Recently, the security of industrial control systems has gained much
   attention as these systems now exhibit an increased interaction with the
   Internet. In fact, classical SCADA systems are already lacking with
   security problems, and with the increased interconnectivity to the
   Internet, they are now exposed to new types of threats and
   cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most
   important security solutions used today in industrial control systems to
   detect potential attacks and malicious activities. This paper summarizes
   previous work for Intrusion Detection Systems approaches in Industrial
   Control Systems and highlights challenges and opportunities in
   implementing such solutions. We believe that such insights are valuable
   for further research in the industrial security context.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are becoming more integral to modern
   life as they are being integrated into critical infrastructure. These
   systems typically lack application layer encryption and the placement of
   common network intrusion services have large blind spots. We propose the
   novel architecture, Cloud Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention
   System (CB-IDPS), to detect and prevent threats in ICS networks by using
   software defined networking (SDN) to route traffic to the cloud for
   inspection using network function virtualization (NFV) and service
   function chaining. CB-IDPS uses Amazon Web Services to create a virtual
   private cloud for packet inspection. The CB-IDPS framework is designed
   with considerations to the ICS delay constraints, dynamic traffic
   routing, scalability, resilience, and visibility. CB-IDPS is presented
   in the context of a micro grid energy management system as the test case
   to prove that the latency of CB-IDPS is within acceptable delay
   thresholds. The implementation of CB-IDPS uses the OpenDaylight software
   for the SDN controller and commonly used network security tools such as
   Zeek and Snort. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using NFV
   in an ICS context for network security.}},

Abstract = {{In a typical manufacturing setup, field sensors are used to detect the
   presence of moving material on the production line. Sensory information
   is interfaced with a centralized control systems for continuous and long
   distance monitoring. However, the field sensors are prone to failures
   and may cause frequent down-times which in turn causes reduction in
   productivity. In this paper, a practical and comprehensive visual
   inspection system is proposed to automatically control the plant
   operations. The proposed approach improves productivity and solves
   several challenges including the speed of execution to support real-time
   operations, number and choice of image processing stages as well as
   associated techniques and algorithms.
   The presented solution inspects a production process deployed in metal
   industry and detects the moving rods on a conveyor platform. The shape
   of the moving rods is characterized using a combination of GrabCut
   segmentation, and clustering-based image thresholding methods. To detect
   and track the movement of rods, proximity contours are identified using
   low-level pixel information of only two images: one when the conveyor is
   fully occupied with the rods and the other when the conveyor is empty.
   Further, this visual sensory information is used to automatically
   generate control logic for tracking and monitoring a conveyor platform
   and can be smoothly integrated with industrial control system enabling
   real-time closed loop operations.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of Internet of Things technology and smart manufacturing,
   the issues of cyber security in industrial control systems (ICS) have
   become of great concern. Critical infrastructures, such as power plants
   and water treatment facilities, which heavily rely on ICS, have
   increasingly come under cyberattack in recent years. These cyberattacks
   pose severe threats to public safety as well as national security.
   Therefore, protecting ICS from cyberattack is an important research
   issue in the era of information technology and operation technology
   convergence. In this study, we propose an anomaly detection method based
   on semi-supervised techniques for industrial control systems, using the
   k-means and convolutional autoencoder methods. Experimental results show
   that the proposed method outperforms the other methods in almost all
   performance metrics for gas pipeline and water storage tank datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to building attack detection systems, such as a
   signature-based approach, do not allow detecting zero-day attacks. To
   improve the performance of attack detection, one resort to use methods
   of machine learning, in particular, neural networks. This paper
   considers the problem of detecting cyber attacks in Industrial Control
   Systems (ICS) using digital signal processing (DSP) technology. By
   processing signals from sensors using a comb of digital low-pass filters
   (LPF), additional informative features, that describe the control
   system, have been created. Experimental studies were conducted on the
   Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, which showed that the use of
   additional features obtained using DSP technologies improves the
   accuracy of detecting cyberattacks on ACS by reducing errors of the
   second kind.}},

   enhances the ability to localize fault position. The Monte-Carlo
   simulations of Statistical Detector show x2 increment in the number of
   detected faults when compared to conventional ECC-based techniques.
   While Isolation and Check helps localize the number of defects up to x4

   65,000 cycles with no performance degradation for testing which could be
   easily integrated into real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been affected
   by heterogeneous cyberattacks that have a huge impact on the physical
   world and the people's safety. Nowadays, the techniques achieving the
   best performance in the detection of cyber anomalies are based on
   Machine Learning and, more recently, Deep Learning. Due to the incipient
   stage of cybersecurity research in ICS, the availability of datasets
   enabling the evaluation of anomaly detection techniques is insufficient.
   In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate reliable anomaly
   detection datasets in ICS that consists of four steps: attacks
   selection, attacks deployment, traffic capture and features computation.
   The proposed methodology has been used to generate the Electra Dataset,
   whose main goal is the evaluation of cybersecurity techniques in an
   electric traction substation used in the railway industry. Using the
   Electra dataset, we train several Machine Learning and Deep Learning
   models to detect anomalies in ICS and the performed experiments show
   that the models have high precision and, therefore, demonstrate the
   suitability of our dataset for use in production systems.}},

   3D-ICs is necessary to achieve zero DPPM (Defect Parts Per Million) in
   the market. Although only functional tests are applied to analog
   circuits such as power distribution networks in general, applying
   structural tests will increase the coverage. This paper proposes to
   measure resistance between a pair of bumps under TSVs (Through Silicon
   Vias) to detect open defects of the TSVs as a part of structural power
   integrity test. Diagnostic performance of each bump pair is evaluated by
   simulations and the best one is selected to detect each TSV defect.
   Resistance threshold for the defect detection is determined considering
   trade-off between fault coverage and yield loss. Experimental
   simulations of power distribution network in a 3D-IC with 2 dies are
   conducted and the trade-off between them is derived.}},

Abstract = {{The search engine Shodan crawls the Internet for, among other things,
   Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ICS are devices used to operate and
   automate industrial processes. Due to the increasing popularity of the
   Internet, these devices are getting more and more connected to the
   Internet. These devices will, if not hidden, be shown on Shodan. This
   study uses Shodan, together with data found by other researches to plot
   the trends of these ICS devices. The studied trends focus on the country
   percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The results show
   that all studied countries, except the United States, have decreased
   their percentage of world total ICS devices. We suspect that this does
   not represent the real story, as companies are getting better at hiding
   their devices from online crawlers. Our results also show that the usage
   of old ICS protocols is increasing. One of the explanations is that
   industrial devices, running old communication protocols, are
   increasingly getting connected to the Internet. In addition to the trend
   study, we evaluate Shodan by studying the time it takes for Shodan to
   index one of our devices on several networks. We also study ways of
   avoiding detection by Shodan and show that, by using a method called
   port knocking, it is relatively easy for a device to hide from Shodan,
   but remain accessible for legitimate users.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect industrial control system to minimize the risk of damage or loss
   of resources. In this paper, an one-class Support Vector Machine based
   extended boundary (EB-OSCVM) is used to detect anomalies in industrial
   multivariate time series data from a simulated Tennessee Eastman Process
   (TEP) with many cyber attacks. In detail, determine the change points of
   each process variable and capture the causality relationship between the
   variables based on the location and time delay of the change points.
   Then, by monitoring the leaf nodes in the causality graph, we can know
   whether the system is abnormal, it can effectively reduce the dimension
   of process data. The EB-OSCVM extend classification boundary of OCSVM in
   order to reduce the error of noise, if data is outside the boundary of
   EB-OCSVM, there is an anomaly. Finally, tracing the anomaly source
   according to causal direction. An experiment is used to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach, the results demonstrate that the
   approach presents a high-accuracy solution and traces the source of
   anomaly correctly.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid increase in digitalization and networking of systems,
   especially in industrial environments, the number of cyber-physical
   systems is increasing and thus the danger of possible attacks on such
   systems. As demonstrated in several recent examples, a cyber attack on
   an industrial control system (ICS) can have catastrophic consequences
   for humans and machines. This is due to the communication networks
   between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors,
   which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or
   devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible
   attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a
   running process, controlled by a PLC, is manipulated without being
   detected. Furthermore, a detection method for such attacks is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Modern indusfrial control systems (ICS) are increasingly becoming
   targets of cyber attacks. Traditional security tools based on a
   signature approach are not always able to detect a new attack, the
   signature of which has not yet been described. In particular, this
   occurs during targeted attacks on indusfrial facilities. Cyber attacks
   can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and
   process equipment under its control. Therefore, to detect attacks, it is
   advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A
   reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning
   techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine
   learning (decision free algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector
   machine) and neural networks. To assess their applicability in the
   problem of detection of ICS anomalies, the Additional Tennessee Eastman
   Process Simulation Data for Anomaly Detection Evaluation and Gas

Abstract = {{An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS
   networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption
   methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy
   equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities
   of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device
   fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion
   detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the
   simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware
   configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing
   time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to
   achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The
   device finger-printing-based intrusion classification and detection
   approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level
   micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the
   proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or
   aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient
   methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is
   introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the
   Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine
   invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds
   to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The
   limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a
   context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting
   dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier
   detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical
   guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of
   outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called
   matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice
   combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility
   to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant
   components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A
   simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and
   provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The
   performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets
   using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively used in modern
   industries combined with the conventional industrial control system
   (ICS) network through the industrial cloud to make the production data
   easily available to the corporate business management and easier control
   for highly profitable production systems. The different devices within
   the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an
   isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of
   the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the
   manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration
   with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks
   are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by
   malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous
   update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts
   from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection
   of ICS.
   Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach
   performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach
   (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization
   of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training
   techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for
   real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat
   detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep
   learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern
   recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure.
   Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the
   domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of
   huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of
   deep learning to design our detection model.
   Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed
   in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data
   for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural
   network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained
   using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about
   the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed
   detection models is that the models are adaptive where training
   procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt
   new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at
   the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks
   and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks.
   Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and
   values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes,
   learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models
   find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other
   parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a
   real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed
   approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms
   and obtain similar performances with earlier semi supervised work (Huda
   et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model. (C)

Abstract = {{Threats that cause malicious function such as information leakage and
   denial of service by adding hardware trojan (HT) to a device constructed
   using inexpensive elements at component level after shipment have been
   reported. The detection method after shipment, which is different from
   HT detection inside IC is required because of the easiness adding
   component-level HT to products. The testing method to detect
   modification on board will achieve the detection of component-level HT.
   In this brief, we focus on the HT implemented in the wiring connected to
   integrated circuits. Since the component connection constantly affects
   the impedance of the wiring, we propose a detection method for such HT
   implemented outside the IC by measuring the change in the impedance of
   the wiring. For the detection of malicious modification after shipment
   it is necessary to excite a pulse signal from the IC that achieves high
   security, such as a secure microcomputer, and observe the signal
   reflected inside the secure IC by the discontinuous portion of the
   impedance on the board. If the reflected signal is different from the
   shipping test, it can be judged that HT is mounted. We adopted time
   domain reflectometry (TDR) to realize the above method, and we
   demonstrate experimental result of component-level HT detection using
   TDR with measuring instrument and TDR from secure IC. As a result, a
   significant change in the amplitude due to the impedance change was
   obtained from the reflected wave measured inside the IC with and without
   the MOSFET used as the HT using this method.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic industry has been experiencing a growing counterfeit
   market, resulting in electronic supply chains in other industries to be
   prone to counterfeit parts as well. Over the past few years, several
   methods have been developed for evaluating the reliability of an IC and
   distinguishing them as counterfeit or authentic. Trained experts offer
   services for evaluating an IC based on destructive or non-destructive
   methods. However, defect detection and recognition are mostly dependent
   on human decision, and therefore are vulnerable to error. In this paper,
   we propose a method to automatically detect and identify die-face
   delamination on an IC die. Die-face delamination is a predominant

Abstract = {{Counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs) has become an increasingly
   vital concern for the security of commercial and mission-critical
   systems. Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety
   threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework
   consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and
   post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets
   several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked,
   out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor
   consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce
   reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic
   properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed
   by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists
   of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a
   recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring
   oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage
   estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a
   more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can
   allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to
   detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor,
   we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect
   and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be
   registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID,
   which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that
   the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared
   to traditional on-chip sensors.}},

Title = {{Anomaly detection for industrial control systems using process mining}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{103-125}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are moving from dedicated
   communications to switched and routed corporate networks, exposing them
   to the Internet and placing them at risk of cyber-attacks. Existing
   methods of detecting cyber-attacks, such as intrusion detection systems
   (IDSs), are commonly implemented in ICS and SCADA networks. However,
   these devices do not detect more complex threats that manifest
   themselves gradually over a period of time through a combination of
   unusual sequencing of activities, such as process-related attacks.
   During the normal operation of ICSs, ICS devices record device logs,
   capturing their industrial processes over time. These logs are a rich
   source of information that should be analysed in order to detect such
   process-related attacks.
   In this paper, we present a novel process mining anomaly detection
   method for identifying anomalous behaviour and cyber-attacks using ICS
   data logs and the conformance checking analysis technique from the
   process mining discipline. A conformance checking analysis uses logs
   captured from production systems with a process model (which captures
   the expected behaviours of a system) to determine the extent to which
   real behaviours (captured in the logs) matches the expected behaviours
   (captured in the process model). The contributions of this paper include
   an experimentally derived recommendation for logging practices on ICS
   devices, for the purpose of process mining-based analysis; a formalised
   approach for pre-processing and transforming device logs from ICS
   systems into event logs suitable for process mining analysis; guidance
   on how to create a process model for ICSs and how to apply the created
   process model through a conformance checking analysis to identify
   anomalous behaviours. Our anomaly detection method has been successfully
   applied in detecting ICS cyber-attacks, which the widely used IDS Snort
   does not detect, using logs derived from industry standard ICS devices.

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries' industrial
   facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough
   security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not
   preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day
   against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical
   infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets.
   For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention
   of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis
   was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the
   most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was
   created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing
   this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the
   critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to
   prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the
   existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In
   the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were
   used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used
   for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach
   will provide significant contributions to attract attention to
   vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems.

Abstract = {{In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling
   (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for
   wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe
   process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for
   detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method
   is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem.
   In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an
   activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to
   decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner
   chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8\%,
   83.3\%, 67.9\%, and 25.4\% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V,
   respectively, for a typical die at 25 degrees C, compared to baseline
   frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is
   suitable for wide-operating-range applications.}},

Abstract = {{The use of control-theoretic solutions to detect attacks against
   cyber-physical industrial systems is a growing area of research.
   Traditional literature proposes the use of control strategies to retain,
   eg, satisfactory close-loop performance, as well as safety properties,
   when a communication network connects the distributed components of a
   physical system (eg, sensors, actuators, and controllers). However, the
   adaptation of these strategies to handle security incidents is an
   ongoing challenge. In this paper, we survey the advantages of a
   watermark-based detector against some integrity attacks as well as the
   weaknesses against other attacks. To cover these weaknesses, we propose
   a new control and security strategy that complements the watermark-based
   detector. We validate the detection efficiency of the new strategy via
   numeric simulation. Experimental results are also presented by using a
   laboratory testbed based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   industrial protocols.}},

Abstract = {{As the main communication mediums in industrial control networks,
   industrial communication protocols are always vulnerable to extreme
   exploitations, and it is very difficult to take protective measures due
   to their serious privacy. Based on the SDN (Software Defined Network)
   technology, this paper proposes a novel event-based anomaly detection
   approach to identify misbehaviors using non-public industrial
   communication protocols, and this approach can be installed in SDN
   switches as a security software appliance in SDN-based control systems.
   Furthermore, aiming at the unknown protocol specification and message
   format, this approach first restructures the industrial communication
   sessions and merges the payloads from industrial communication packets.
   After that, the feature selection and event sequence extraction can be
   carried out by using the N-gram model and K-means algorithm. Based on
   the obtained event sequences, this approach finally trains an
   event-based HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to identify aberrant industrial
   communication behaviors. Experimental results clearly show that the
   proposed approach has obvious advantages of classification accuracy and
   detection efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which are an integration of computation,
   networking, and physical processes, play an increasingly important role
   in critical infrastructure, government and everyday life. Due to
   physical constraints, embedded computers and networks may give rise to
   some additional security vulnerabilities, which results in losses of
   enormous economy benefits or disorder of social life. As a result, it is
   of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to
   ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper,
   from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent
   advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs.
   First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for
   the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of
   cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and
   deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective.
   Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are
   discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The
   development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed
   according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the
   security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally,
   some challenge issues are raised for the future research. (c) 2017

Abstract = {{Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans.
   Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for
   hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult
   to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based
   golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the
   algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without
   considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the
   simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from
   actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective
   classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan
   detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate
   simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing
   fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips.
   First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs.
   During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in
   the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the
   further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a
   statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm
   in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the
   increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique
   for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to
   obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training
   method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark
   circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans
   with high accuracy (92\%similar to 97\%) and recall (88\%similar to
   95\%).}},

Abstract = {{Due its complexity and a multitude of proprietary components, industrial
   control systems are an immanently difficult field of application for
   intrusion detection. Proprietary binary protocols and the lack of public
   specifications have forced the research community to move away from
   content-based detection to more abstract concepts. In this paper, we
   show that in contrast to prior belief the content of unknown binary
   protocols can very well be modeled. ZOE derives prototype models that
   are specific to individual types of messages in order to capture the
   characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enable detecting
   different forms of attacks as anomalies. In an evaluation based on 6
   days of network traffic recorded at a large power plant (1,900 MW) with
   over 92,000 unique devices, we demonstrate that ZOE improves upon
   related approaches by up to an order of magnitude in detection
   performance, but also significantly decreases false positives.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of modern information technologies with industrial
   control systems has created an enormous interest in the security of
   industrial control, however, given the cost, variety, and industry
   practices, it is hard for researchers to test and deploy security
   solutions in real-world systems. Industrial control testbeds can be used
   as tools to test security solutions before they are deployed, and in
   this paper we extend our previous work to develop open-source virtual
   industrial control testbeds where computing and networking components
   are emulated and virtualized, and the physical system is simulated
   through differential equations. In particular, we implement a nonlinear
   control system emulating a three-water tank with the associated sensors,
   PLCs, and actuators that communicate through an emulated network. In
   addition, we design unknown input observers (UIO) to not only detect
   that an attack is occurring, but also to identify the source of the
   malicious false data injections and mitigate its impact. Our system is
   available through Github to the academic community.}},

Abstract = {{As closed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) gradually evolve toward
   networking, ICS data and operational processes can be easily tampered
   with by attackers, causing industrial control equipment to fail or
   become damaged. Depending on the characteristics of ICS business logic
   stability, this paper proposes a novel two-level anomaly detection
   framework to ensure that system data and business logic are safe and
   reliable. Specifically, basic information is obtained from network
   traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification.
   In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer
   algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the
   input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer
   model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the
   normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown
   attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline
   network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection
   framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance
   than several current latest technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is closely related to
   national security. With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS,
   highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system
   (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection
   threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection
   indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion
   detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in
   industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy
   consumption varies according to different operation types and system
   states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation,
   system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put
   forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on
   multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about
   power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system
   state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the
   multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm.
   Experimental results verify that our approach has a better detection
   performance than other detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, the outbreak of Stuxnet sounded a warning in the field of
   industrial control security. As the major attack form of Stuxnet, data
   injection attack is characterized by high concealment and great
   destructiveness. This paper proposes a new method to detect data
   injection attack in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), in which Long
   Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) is a temporal
   sequences predictor. We then use the Euclidean detector to identify
   attacks in a model of a chemical plant. With simulation and evaluation
   in Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, we show that this method is able to
   detect various types of data injection attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Today's globalized electronics supply chain is prone to counterfeit chip
   proliferation. Existing techniques to detect counterfeit integrated
   circuits (ICs) are limited by relatively high cost, lengthy inspection
   time, destructive nature, and restriction to a pre-packaging
   environment. We propose a novel method of counterfeit IC detection which
   takes advantage of design-specific electromagnetic (EM) fingerprints
   generated by simulating on-chip clock distribution networks. Through
   exploitation of the chip's physical characteristics, our technique can
   help detect foundry of origin. We validate our approach on 8051
   micro-controllers from three different vendors and utilize principal
   component analysis to distinguish the acquisitions by vendor. Our
   results show that near-field EM measurements combined with unsupervised
   machine learning provide approximate to 99\% accuracy in counterfeit
   detection through design-specific fingerprint classification.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of networks and computers, industrial control
   systems (ICS) have become more interconnected. Many ICS are allowed
   remote interactions through the Internet. This increases the security
   risks of being attacked. If critical infrastructure ICS are attacked,
   the consequences could be catastrophic. To protect the ICS, the
   anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (ABNIDS) are used to
   detect novel cyber-attacks by learning both normal and abnormal network
   behaviours. The quality of the attack dataset directly influences the
   accuracy of the ABNIDS. Therefore, it is important to assess the quality
   of the attack datasets used to design and develop ABNIDS. To fulfil this
   goal, this paper provides assessment criteria for evaluating ICS attack
   datasets. These new assessment criteria demonstrate the various
   requirements of the dataset and analyse the effectiveness of the dataset
   in depth. Three existing ICS attack datasets for the DNP3, S7comm and
   Modbus protocols are assessed using these criteria. We find that there
   is a range of dataset creation techniques and levels of quality with no
   dataset that meets the ideal criteria. Since no existing work discusses
   assessment criteria for ICS attack datasets, this paper would be helpful
   to evaluate and improve the ICS attack datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection for industrial control systems (ICS) can leverage
   process data to detect malicious derivations from expected process
   behavior. We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state
   dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an
   attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system
   provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowledge of the
   network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of
   residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel
   state-aware anomaly detection technique. We implement and evaluate our
   anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the
   process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train
   the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the
   ICS. The results show that the proposed method improves prior works by
   providing less time-to-detect of attacks while generating fewer false

Abstract = {{For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced
   failures in dual damascene copper interconnects in today's and future
   sub-10nm ICs, one critical issue is how to create stressing conditions
   so that the chip will fail exclusively under EM in a very short period
   of time so that EM signoff and validation can be carried out
   efficiently. In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration
   techniques for practical VLSI chips. We will first review the recently
   proposed three-phase physics-based EM models and discuss the important
   factors contributing to the EM aging process. Then we propose a new
   formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general
   multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality
   check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure
   process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based
   acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with
   reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to
   significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable
   reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM
   accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we
   show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing
   temperature. On average, 10\% increase in temperature yields about 10X
   wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is
   not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations
   which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM,
   and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it
   is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying
   within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration
   techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and
   reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10
   years down to a few hours (about 10(5) acceleration) under the 150
   degrees C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM
   testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.}},

   The specifications are synthesized as monitors that read the execution

Abstract = {{The continuous growth of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) poses a
   serious threat to our critical infrastructures due to their inferior
   quality and has become one of the major concerns to the government and
   the industry. Detection of these ICs is challenging especially when they
   have been used for a short period of time, as the process variations
   (especially in lower technology nodes) could outpace the degradation
   caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a robust, accurate, and
   low-cost solution for efficient detection of recycled ICs, even if they
   have been used for a very short period of time. The proposed solution
   utilizes a ring oscillator (RO), and a nonvolatile memory. It stores the
   RO frequency, conditions (e.g., supply voltage, temperature, and
   duration) for the frequency measurement, and a digital signature. The
   simulation and silicon results demonstrate that we can effectively
   detect recycled ICs used as low as one day.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems are the fundamental infrastructures of a
   country. Since the intrusion attack methods for industrial control
   systems have become complex and concealed, the traditional protection
   methods, such as vulnerability database, virus database and rule
   matching cannot cope with the attacks hidden inside the terminals of
   industrial control systems. In this work, we propose a control flow
   anomaly detection algorithm based on the control flow of the business
   programs. First, a basic group partition method based on key paths is
   proposed to reduce the performance burden caused by tabbed-assert
   control flow analysis method through expanding basic research units.
   Second, the algorithm phases of standard path set acquisition and path
   matching are introduced. By judging whether the current control flow
   path is deviating from the standard set or not, the abnormal operating
   conditions of industrial control can be detected. Finally, the
   effectiveness of a control flow anomaly detection (checking) algorithm
   based on Path Matching (CFCPM) is demonstrated by anomaly detection
   ability analysis and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing industrial control systems (ICSs), such as building energy
   management systems (EMSs), were installed when potential security
   threats were only physical. With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now,
   typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be
   accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the
   potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact
   ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage,
   safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a
   novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which
   incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a
   reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an
   attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already
   implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the
   controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the
   proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real
   EMS site and simulated attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as water and power are critical to
   any society. Process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect such systems to minimize the risk of damage or loss of
   resources. In this paper, a graphical model-based approach is proposed
   for profiling normal operational behavior of an operational ICS referred
   to as SWaT (Secure Water Treatment). Timed automata are learned as a
   model of regular behaviors shown in sensors signal like fluctuations of
   water level in tanks. Bayesian networks are learned to discover
   dependencies between sensors and actuators. The models are used as a
   one-class classifier for process anomaly detection, recognizing
   irregular behavioral patterns and dependencies. The detection results
   can be interpreted and the abnormal sensors or actuators localized due
   to the interpretability of the graphical models. This approach is
   applied to a dataset collected from SWaT. Experimental results
   demonstrate the model's superior performance on both precision and
   run-time over methods including support vector machine and deep neural
   networks. The underlying idea is generic and applicable to other
   industrial control systems such as power and transportation.}},

Abstract = {{A wideband microwave method is described as a means for rapid detection
   of slight dissimilarities and aging effects in integrated circuits
   (ICs). The method is based on measuring the complex reflection
   coefficient of an IC when illuminated with an open-ended rectangular
   waveguide probe, at K-band (18-26.5 GHz) and Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz)
   microwave frequencies. The spatially integrated reflected
   electromagnetic signature of a given IC is a function of its internal
   material properties, geometry and metallic deposition of circuit
   element, and wire bonds. Consequently, dissimilar (including
   counterfeit) and aged ICs exhibit markedly different reflection
   properties than their reference and new (nonaged) counterparts. In
   addition to measuring spatially integrated complex reflection
   coefficient (over the waveguide aperture), it is also integrated over
   the operating frequency band (spectrally integrated), resulting in
   significant increase in the robustness of the approach.
   Root-mean-squared-error, defined as the average Euclidean distance
   between two reflection coefficient vectors, is used to associate a
   quantitative metric to the complex reflection coefficient difference
   between two dissimilar ICs. Measurement results on several sets of ICs
   having the same package (DIP-14) and different functionalities, similar
   functionalities with slight differences in specifications, and aged ICs
   are presented. The results clearly indicate the capability of this
   method to differentiate among ICs having slight differences in packaging
   material properties and/or electronic circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
   Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to
   be highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to
   asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of
   multiplexed ICS streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for
   anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA and a high
   false-alarm rate. In this article, we introduce a new modeling approach
   that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple
   DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that
   de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to
   their respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the
   statechart from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning
   algorithms first build a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the
   stream. Next, we split the symbols into sets, one per multiplexed cycle,
   based on symbol frequencies and node degrees in the DTMC graph. Then, we
   create a sub-graph for each cycle and extract Euler cycles for each
   sub-graph. The final statechart is comprised of one DFA per Euler cycle.
   The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, which appear in more than
   one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once in a cycle.
   We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the
   Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a
   collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed
   ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap.
   The algorithms were able to split the symbols into sets with 99.6\%
   accuracy. The resulting statechart modeled the traces with a median
   false-alarm rate of as low as 0.483\%. In all but the most extreme
   scenarios, the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm
   rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in Taiwan
   Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC's) 0.35-mu m technology, we
   demonstrate the operation of two hardware Trojans, which leak the secret
   key of a wireless cryptographic integrated circuit (IC) consisting of an
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core and an ultrawideband (UWB)
   transmitter (TX). With their impact carefully hidden in the transmission
   specification margins allowed for process variations, these hardware
   Trojans cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the
   digital or the analog part of the IC and do not violate the transmission
   protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed
   adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power
   waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked
   with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB TX. Moreover,
   through physical measurements and MATLAB simulations, we show that the
   attack facilitated by these hardware Trojans is robust to test equipment
   and communication channel noise. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the
   effectiveness of a popular hardware Trojan detection method, namely,
   statistical side-channel fingerprinting via trained one-class
   classifiers, in detecting the hardware Trojans introduced in our
   fabricated IC population.}},

   captured the communication packets between different nodes in the

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are moving from dedicated
   communications to Ethernet-based interconnected networks, placing them
   at risk of cyber attack. ICS networks are typically monitored by an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), however traditional IDSs do not detect
   attacks which disrupt the control flow of an ICS. ICSs are unique in the
   repetition and restricted number of tasks that are undertaken. Thus
   there is the opportunity to use Process Mining, a series of techniques
   focused on discovering, monitoring and improving business processes, to
   detect ICS control flow anomalies. In this paper we investigate the
   suitability of various process mining discovery algorithms for the task
   of detecting cyber attacks on ICSs by examining logs from control
   devices. Firstly, we identify the requirements of this unique
   environment, and then evaluate the appropriateness of several commonly
   used process discovery algorithms to satisfy these requirements.
   Secondly, the comparison was performed and validated using ICS logs
   derived from a case study, containing successful attacks on industrial
   control systems. Our research shows that the Inductive Miner process
   discovery method, without the use of noise filtering, is the most
   suitable for discovering a process model that is effective in detecting
   cyber-attacks on industrial control systems, both in time spent and
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm
   (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA)
   is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search
   ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal
   solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive
   proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and
   local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using
   the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA).
   In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve
   the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local
   optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current
   global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local
   optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test
   functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of
   support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion
   detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with
   BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of

   However, due to the particularity of the industrial control system, the

   this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection algorithm called
   OPSO-BPNN which is suitable for industrial control system. Our algorithm
   optimizes the particle swarm algorithm with nonlinear reduction inertia

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) used in industrial plants are
   vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can cause fatal damage to the plants.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor ICS network traffic and

   cyber-attacks because it is hard to make a complete database of
   cyber-attacks and distinguish operational anomalies when compared to an
   established baseline. In this paper, a discriminant model between normal
   and anomalous packets was constructed with a support vector machine
   (SVM) based on an ICS communication profile, which represents only
   packet intervals and length, and an IDS with the applied model is
   proposed. Furthermore, the proposed IDS was evaluated using penetration
   tests on our cyber security test bed. Although the IDS was constructed
   by the limited features (intervals and length) of packets, the IDS
   successfully detected cyber-attacks by monitoring the rate of predicted
   attacking packets.}},

   we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is
   designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic.
   SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep
   inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the
   characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic
   relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep
   inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection.
   Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our
   SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are found in critical infrastructure
   such as for power generation and water treatment. When security
   requirements are incorporated into an ICS, one needs to test the
   additional code and devices added do improve the prevention and
   detection of cyber attacks. Conducting such tests in legacy systems is a
   challenge due to the high availability requirement. An approach using
   Timed Automata (TA) is proposed to overcome this challenge. This
   approach enables assessment of the effectiveness of an attack detection
   method based on process invariants. The approach has been demonstrated
   in a case study on one stage of a 6stage operational water treatment
   plant. The model constructed captured the interactions among components
   in the selected stage. In addition, a set of attacks, attack detection
   mechanisms, and security specifications were also modeled using TA.
   These TA models were conjoined into a network and implemented in UPPAAL.
   The models so implemented were found effective in detecting the attacks
   considered. The study suggests the use of TA as an effective tool to
   model an ICS and study its attack detection mechanisms as a complement
   to doing so in a real plant-operational or under design.}},

Abstract = {{We outline an anomaly detection method for industrial control systems
   (ICS) that combines the analysis of network package contents that are
   transacted between ICS nodes and their time-series structure.
   Specifically, we take advantage of the predictable and regular nature of
   communication patterns that exist between so-called field devices in ICS
   networks. By observing a system for a period of time without the
   presence of anomalies we develop a base-line signature database for
   general packages. A Bloom filter is used to store the signature database
   which is then used for package content level anomaly detection.
   Furthermore, we approach time-series anomaly detection by proposing a
   stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based softmax classifier
   which learns to predict the most likely package signatures that are
   likely to occur given previously seen package traffic. Finally, by the
   inspection of a real dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system,
   we show that an anomaly detection scheme combining both approaches can
   achieve higher performance compared to various current state-of-the-art
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have posed a major security and
   safety threat on commercial and mission-critical systems. In this paper,
   we propose to develop a comprehensive counterfeit ICs detection and
   prevention strategy, consisting of an innovative multi-functional
   on-chip sensor and a related post-fabrication authentication
   methodology. We target at many counterfeit ICs including the
   recycled/remarked/out-of-spec ICs, as well as cloned and over-produced
   ICs. First, the new sensor consists of antifuse memory and aging sensors
   to reduce reference circuit related area overhead of those sensor
   circuits. Second, the new sensor combines both the ring-oscillator based
   aging sensor with recently proposed electromigration(EM)-based aging
   sensor so that it can be effective for estimation of both short and long
   period time of chip usage. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a
   new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent
   non-defective counterfeit ICs. Simulation results show the advantage of
   the proposed multifunctional sensor against existing on-chip sensors in
   terms of functionality, detection coverage and usage time estimation
   range and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and
   control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater
   interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication
   systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage
   Ethernet to allow interoperability between solutions from different
   vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect,
   created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers.
   Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely
   implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical
   systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise
   of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that
   defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets.
   This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyber-defensive
   architecture by using a Raspberry Pi based ModbusTCP control system that
   enables simulation of cyber-attacks, and illustrates a mitigation
   measure with the added feature of Modbus monitoring using Snort.}},

Abstract = {{Developments and upgrades in the field of industrial information
   technology, particularly those relating to information systems'
   technologies for the collection and processing of real-time data, have
   introduced a large number of new threats. These threats are primarily
   related to the specific tasks these applications perform, such as their
   distinct design specifications, the specialized communication protocols
   they use and the heterogeneous devices they are required to
   interconnect. In particular, specialized attacks can undertake
   mechanical control, dynamic rearrangement of centrifugation or
   reprogramming of devices in order to accelerate or slow down their
   operations. This may result in total industrial equipment being
   destroyed or permanently damaged. Cyber-attacks against Industrial
   Control Systems which mainly use Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) combined with Distributed Control Systems are
   implemented with Programmable Logic Controllers. They are characterized
   as Advanced Persistent Threats. This paper presents an advanced Spiking
   One-Class Anomaly Detection Framework (SOCCADF) based on the evolving
   Spiking Neural Network algorithm. This algorithm implements an
   innovative application of the One-class classification methodology since
   it is trained exclusively with data that characterize the normal
   operation of ICS and it is able to detect divergent behaviors and
   abnormalities associated with APT attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The critical infrastructure, which includes the electric power grid,
   railroads and water treatment facilities, is dependent on the proper
   operation of industrial control systems. However, malware such as
   Stuxnet has demonstrated the ability to alter industrial control system
   parameters to create physical effects. Of particular concern is malware
   that targets embedded devices that monitor and control system
   functionality, while masking the actions from plant operators and
   security analysts. Indeed, system security relies on guarantees that the
   assurance of these devices can be maintained throughout their lifetimes.
   This paper presents a novel approach that uses timing-based side channel
   analysis to establish a unique device fingerprint that helps detect
   unauthorized modifications of the device. The approach is applied to an
   Allen Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controller where execution
   time measurements are collected and analyzed by a custom anomaly
   detection system to detect abnormal behavior. The anomaly detection
   system achieves true positive rates of 0.978-1.000 with false positive
   rates of 0.033-0.044. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of
   using timing-based side channel analysis to detect anomalous behavior in
   programmable logic controllers. Published'by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used ``air-gap{''}
   security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from
   other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect.
   Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers
   who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the
   air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little
   to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This
   paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network
   attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted
   through the network but is not inherently the data used by the
   transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the
   developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when
   differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same
   network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker
   and engineer on the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the number of information security incidents of

   detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive

   Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and
   can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency
   on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an
   important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP
   is very important for the industry controlling systems which use
   Profinet to connect. To realize the detection for Profinet RT signal,
   this paper expanded the snort packet decoding engine, and designed a
   preprocessor plug-ins for Profinet RT signal. Experimental result shows
   that the improved Snort can support the intrusion detection for Profinet

Abstract = {{Industrial realize that SCADA System was built without considering the
   security aspect. It was believe that there will be no attacks go to the
   SCADA plant using malware, such as botnet. Botnets are now the key
   platform for many Internet attacks, such as spam, distributed
   denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing. Most of the
   current botnet detection approaches work only on specific botnet command
   and control (C\&C) protocols (e.g., IRC) and structures (e.g.,
   centralized), and can become ineffective as botnets change their C\&C
   techniques. In this research, we study vertexnet malware attack on a
   SCADA Server so that it can identify a SCADA Operator machine. The
   identification was used by analyzing and comparing process list which is
   run on the infecting host, so the attacker didn't take the wrong target,
   taking over the SCADA and sending some command to disrupt or operate the
   plant or machine, and to identifying of Botnet Vertexnet function and
   activity. From the experiment conducted, we get result that botnet
   Vertexnet can identifying SCADA Operator, taking over the server, and
   the activity can be detected effectively and efficiently.}},

   industrial control software as the taint source file of taint analysis
   and the sample file of fuzzing. First, find key data which is most
   likely to have potential safety hazard in the configuration file through
   dynamic taint analysis. Then, mutate the data and generate abnormal data

Abstract = {{We have developed a process-oriented method for intrusion detection for
   use on Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. Network traffic from an
   ICS has a much lower volume than that from a typical IT enterprise
   network, and the traffic is much more regular (periodic) and
   predictable. Most intrusion detection systems for ICSs require
   additional capabilities. ICS network traffic is relatively predictable
   and regular and anomaly-based intrusion detection methods have been
   shown in the literature to work reasonably well. We use anomaly-based
   methods as one line of defense. We propose to strengthen ICS intrusion
   detection methods by adding two process-oriented alerting methods.
   Unlike most anomaly detection methods, these two methods are not
   configured solely by a network engineer based on inspection of network
   traffic. We utilize Critical Process Variables, which are defined by the
   plant operators themselves. The advantage is that the plant operators
   have the best knowledge of the critical assets of their system. Limiting
   values of the Critical Process Variables are defined collaboratively by
   the plant operator and the network security engineer. A network sensor
   then alerts a Human Analyst when Critical Process Variables values
   exceed the defined ranges. We also introduce a third method, which
   employs Process Network Parameter Metrics, which are also defined
   collaboratively with the plant operator. Process Network Parameter
   Metrics are pre-defined measurements from network traffic that may
   indicate that either process components are missing or there is
   additional traffic present that the process should not normally produce.
   After initial discussions with the plant operator, the network security
   engineer designs network models and metrics with appropriate alerting
   functions in the network sensor. Alerts from Process Network Parameter
   Metrics may not indicate a critical security incident as Critical
   Process Variables would, but they may provide an important warning that
   suspicious behavior is present.}},

Abstract = {{Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems
   (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such
   as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and
   specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they
   often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost
   solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively
   polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could
   fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices
   (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be
   resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which
   are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these
   challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring
   approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors
   specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS,
   SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness
   of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity
   of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks
   at a rate of 99\%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of
   81-93\%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating
   few attack scenarios generating false negatives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hierarchical monitoring intrusion detection
   system (HAMIDS) for industrial control systems (ICS). The HAMIDS
   framework detects the anomalies in both level 0 and level 1 of an
   industrial control plant. In addition, the framework aggregates the
   cyber-physical process data in one point for further analysis as part of
   the intrusion detection process. The novelty of this framework is its
   ability to detect anomalies that have a distributed impact on the
   cyber-physical process. The performance of the proposed framework
   evaluated as part of SWaT security showdown (S3) in which six
   international teams were invited to test the framework in a real
   industrial control system. The proposed framework outperformed other
   proposed academic IDS in term of detection of ICS threats during the S3
   event, which was held from July 25-29, 2016 at Singapore University of

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are employed to monitor and
   control safety-critical industrial processes. A Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is an ICS to perform centralized
   monitoring and also to control field sites in long-distance
   communication networks. A SCADA is a distributed system composed of
   several Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and a Master Terminal Unit (MTU).
   RTUs interface with field sensors, local control devices, and field
   actuators, and the MTU gathers data from RTUs, provides an operator
   interface to display information, and controls remote sites. RTUs are
   typically connected to the MTU through a client/server network. Since
   RTUs operate commonly in a harsh industrial environment, fault tolerance
   is a key requirement, especially for safety-critical industrial
   processes. Studies show that a significant number of transient faults
   caused by a harsh environment lead to control flow errors in the RTU's
   processors. A control flow checking technique, called PLC-CFC, has been
   proposed to detect control flow errors in several RTUs in a SCADA
   system. The proposed technique can be applied to all ICSs which employ
   microcontrollers, microprocessors, PLCs, or personal computers as their
   RTUs. The proposed technique has been experimentally evaluated on a real
   ICS consists of some PLC devices and a main server. For experimental
   evaluation, 30,000 faults were injected on distributed system and the
   PLC-CFC technique detected more than 96.76\% of the injected faults. The
   performance and the memory overheads of the technique are about 18.12\%
   and 16.17\% on average, respectively.}},

   The methodology can be used to identify specific physical processes and

Abstract = {{The counterfeiting and recycled integrated circuits (ICs) has become a
   major security threat for commercial and military systems. In addition
   to the huge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety
   threats on those systems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight
   on-chip aging sensor, which is based on the electromigration
   (EM)-induced aging effects for fast detection and prevention of recycled
   ICs. Our new EM-based aging sensor exploits the natural aging/failure
   mechanism of interconnect wires to time the aging of the chip. Compared
   with existing aging sensor, the new aging sensor can provide more
   accurate prediction of the chip usage time at smaller area footprints
   due to its simple structure. The new sensor is based on a newly proposed
   physics-based stress evolution model of EM effects for accurate
   prediction of the EM failure. As a result, we can design the
   interconnect wire structures based on copper interconnect technology so
   that the resulting wires will have detectable EM failure at a specific
   time with sufficient accuracy. In order to mitigate the problem of the
   inherent variations in the metal grain sizes and assess its impacts on
   the nucleation time of metal wires, a number of parallel properly
   structured wires are used in the sensor. The parameters of the wires are
   optimized using the new EM model. Our statistical and variational
   analysis shows that the proposed aging sensor can accurately predict the
   targeted failure times in the presence of both inherent uncertainties.
   Our study also shows that more parallel wires will lead to more accurate
   statistical predictions at costs of more areas.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of ICS, PLC and SCADA systems are interconnected
   with Ethernet and directly connected to internet, which greatly improve
   the efficiency of data sharing and introduced in security threats at the
   same time. Once crack fault occurrence of critical infrastructure will
   result in casualties and great economic loss. Peach Fuzzer is an
   advanced and extensible fuzzing platform and is restricted to those with
   TCP/UDP-based protocols on Windows Platform, the PN-DCP would not be
   supported without publisher to send PDU correctly. So it is urgent to
   develop an additional publisher for PN-DCP. In this paper, we propose a
   novel Peach improvement on Profinet-DCP for industrial control system
   vulnerability detection. We analyze the importance of vulnerability
   detecting for PN-DCP with Peach Fuzzer. Then, introducing the Peach
   Framework, the hierarchy of Profinet-DCP and the PitFile of
   Profinet-DCP. We also evaluate our approach through experiments, the
   results can fully satisfy the requirement of vulnerability detecting of
   PN-DCP on Peach platform.}},

Abstract = {{Malicious tampering of the internal circuits of ICs can lead to
   detrimental results. Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system
   behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This
   paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection.
   It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a
   design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering
   algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other
   algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We
   neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the
   effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the
   output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this
   information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub
   benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The
   results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100\%
   coverage with low false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a Concurrent Hardware Trojan Detection (CHTD) methodology
   for wireless cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs), based on
   continuous extraction of a side-channel fingerprint and evaluation by a
   trained on-chip neural classifier. While similar statistical
   side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the
   past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically,
   during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be
   easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times
   except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology
   operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is,
   therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is
   demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a
   custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware
   Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a
   Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and
   (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC.
   Experimental results corroborate that the proposed CHTD methodology
   effectively identifies hardware Trojans when they are active, while not
   incurring any false positives when they are absent or dormant.}},

Abstract = {{Defects in through-silicon vias (TSVs) due to fabrication steps decrease
   the yield and reliability of 3-D stacked integrated circuits, and hence
   these defects need to be detected early to reduce chip's DPM. In this
   paper, a new fault detection and repair method for TSVs in 3D-ICs is
   proposed. The contribution of the method is to detect stuck-at-faults
   and delay-based fault in TSV by a scan-based built-in self-test (BIST)
   architecture. This test architecture supports both pre-bond and
   post-bond TSV testing. By constructing RC model and analyzing the delay
   characteristics of TSV, the variation of TSV-to-substrate resistance
   caused by TSV defects can be mapped to the change of path delay so that
   the related fault can be detected. Based on the test architecture, we
   propose a TSV redundancy structure to repair circuit after failed TSVs
   are detected. Results of fault detection effectiveness are presented
   through ModelSim simulations using realistic models under 65 nm CMOS
   technology. And redundancy design leads to 99.9846\% recovery rate for
   TSVs with only 0.2\% redundancy rate of TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hemolysis is the main cause of non-quality samples in
   clinical laboratories, producing the highest percentage of rejections in
   the external assurance programs of preanalytical quality. The objective
   was to: 1) study the agreement between the detection methods and
   quantification of hemolysis; 2) establish comparable hemolysis
   interference limits for a series of tests and analytical methods; and 3)
   study the preanalytical variables which most influence hemolysis
   production.
   Methods: Different hemoglobin concentration standards were prepared
   using the reference method. Agreement was studied between automated
   methods {[}hemolytic indexes (HI)] and reference method, as well as the
   interference according to hemolysis degree in various biochemical tests
   was measured. Preanalytical variables which could influence hemolysis
   production were studied: type of extraction, type of tubes, transport
   time, temperature and centrifugation conditions.
   Results: Good agreement was obtained between hemoglobin concentrations
   measured using the reference method and HI, for the most of studied
   analyzers, particularly those giving quantitative HI. The hemolysis
   interference cut-off points obtained for the majority of tests studied
   (except LDH, K) are dependent on the method/analyzer utilized.
   Furthermore, discrepancies have been observed between interference
   limits recommended by the manufacturer. The preanalytical variables
   which produce a lower percentage of hemolysis rejections were:
   centrifugation at the extraction site, the use of lower volume tubes and
   a transport time under 15 min at room temperature.
   Conclusions: The setting of interference limits (cut-off) for each used
   test/method, and the study of preanalytical variability will assist to
   the results harmonization for this quality indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The counterfeiting and recycling of integrated circuits (ICs) have
   become major issues in recent years, potentially impacting the security
   and reliability of electronic systems bound for military, financial, or
   other critical applications. With identical functionality and packaging,
   it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused
   ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are
   proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when
   used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring
   oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques
   presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis
   is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the
   sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based
   sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to
   record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or
   switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design.
   Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm
   test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification
   of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in
   AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short
   period, can be accurately identified.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCI), involving cyber and
   physical systems, are exposed to intelligent cyber attacks targeting the
   stable operation of these systems. In order to ensure anomaly awareness,
   the observed data can be used in accordance with data mining techniques
   to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Anomaly Detection
   Systems (ADS). There is an increase in the volume of sensor data
   generated by both cyber and physical sensors, so there is a need to
   apply Big Data technologies for real-time analysis of large data sets.
   In this paper, we propose a clustering based approach for detecting
   cyber attacks that cause anomalies in NCI. Various clustering techniques
   are explored to choose the most suitable for clustering the time-series
   data features, thus classifying the states and potential cyber attacks
   to the physical system. The Hadoop implementation of MapReduce paradigm
   is used to provide a suitable processing environment for large datasets.
   A case study on a NCI consisting of multiple gas compressor stations is

   rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traffic data
   sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads
   to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the
   results, cannot compare the effectiveness of different intrusion
   detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of
   intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks.
   Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to
   compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper
   describes four data sets, which include network traffic, process control
   and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two
   laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the MODBUS
   application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available,
   enable effective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A novel magnetostrictive-ring type torque sensor has been developed

   permendur Fe49Co49V2 which was attached to the stainless shaft. The
   magnetic sensor was constructed using a pair of commercial Hall ICs and
   a permalloy magnetic yoke embedded onto the circuit board. The
   temperature offset adjustment was accomplished by adding only four
   diodes and resistors to differential amplifiers. The measured
   sensitivity was 45 mV/Nm for the applied torque range from -4 Nm to +4

   circuit (IC) consisting of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core

   hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process
   variations, this hardware Trojan cannot be detected by production
   testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and
   does not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level
   specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to
   look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving
   the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block
   sent by the UWB transmitter. Using silicon measurements from 40 chips
   fabricated in TSMC's 0.35 mu m technology, we also assess the
   effectiveness of a side channel-based statistical analysis method in

Abstract = {{The nature of the traffic in industrial control system network is
   markedly different from more open networks. Industrial control system
   networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic
   diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are
   currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning
   based anomaly detection.
   Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial
   control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse
   detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based
   approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for
   different restricted network environments of which an industrial control
   system network is an good example of.
   In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a
   ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both
   control data and the data flowing between the control network and the
   office network. A set of possible features to be used for detecting
   anomalies is studied for this environment.}},

Abstract = {{Interconnect imperfections have become an important issue in modern
   nanometer technologies. Some of them cause Small Delay Defects (SDDs)
   which are difficult to detect. Those SDDs not detected during testing
   may pose a reliability problem. Furthermore, nanometer issues (e.g.
   process variations, spatial correlations) represent important challenges
   for traditional delay test methods. In this paper, a methodology to
   compute the Detection Probability (DP) of resistive open and bridge
   defects using a statistical timing framework that takes into account
   process variations and other nanometer issues is proposed. The DP gives
   the sensitivity of the circuit performance to a given resistance range
   of the defect. The efficiency issue when analyzing large circuits is
   alleviated using stratified sampling techniques to reduce the space of
   possible analyzed defect locations This methodology is applied to some
   ISCAS benchmark circuits. The obtained results show the feasibility of
   the proposed methodology. Measures can be taken for those circuits
   presenting non-acceptable DP in order to improve the test quality.}},

Abstract = {{There have been serious concerns recently about the security of
   microchips from hardware trojan horse insertion during manufacturing.
   This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip
   manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important
   consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics,
   communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted
   into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is
   triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload
   error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a
   trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The
   problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few
   works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem
   based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides
   procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to
   detect trojan effects. We also provide experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel design method for Kalman filter based on
   fuzzy state estimation with online time-delay detector for industrial
   wireless networked control-systems. Firstly, the description of T-S
   fuzzy model-of industrial wireless networked control systems is given.
   Secondly, the distribution of network induced time-delay is detected by
   online detector, and the distribution probabilities of induced
   time-delay within different distribution are fingered out using
   probability method. Meanwhile, the T-S fuzzy model takes the
   distribution probabilities as membership functions. Then, the local
   filters with respect to all distribution are designed by applying method
   of Kalman filter, and a global agonic filter is developed by employing
   fuzzy fusing technique to all of local filters. Finally, the simulation
   on this design is carried out to verify its feasibility.}},

   Wavelet decomposition is used to perform the preprocessing of input data

   Moreover, we show that wavelet analysis brings significant enhancement
   in the correct classification and makes the neural network-based test

Abstract = {{Little work has previously been reported on the use of fuzzy logic
   within statistical process control when this is used for fault detection
   as part of quality control systems in industrial manufacturing
   processes. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential use of fuzzy
   logic to enhance the performance of statistical process control (SPC).
   The cumulative sum of the deviation in the monitored parameter is
   combined with the deviation in an attempt to discriminate between false
   alarms and real faults and, consequently, to improve the quality of the
   solution. Combinations of control rules are utilized and trained to cope
   with different inputs such that rejection of false alarms is achieved

   preliminary result can be obtained at the end of the day following the
   day of arrival of the sample, i.e. in an investigation time of 24 to 28
   hrs. This method was compared to the widely accepted rapid, sensitive
   and low-cost MSRV method. Both methods were applied on frozen as well as
   chilled poultry meat samples. After some modification of the Vidas
   ICS/SLM enrichment protocol, no significant differences between MSRV and
   Vidas SLM were found in 36 chilled and 58 frozen meat samples. The Vidas
   ICS/SLM produced no False positive results.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional testing is based on applying signals to circuit inputs and
   observing logic state of outputs. However; with the introduction of CMOS
   technology a new test technique emerged, that is bared on applying
   signal inputs and observing standby electrical current. This technique
   is known as IDDQ testing. In most CMOS circuits, when all inputs are
   frozen in place and circuit transient activities settle down, the
   current drops by 3-5 orders of magnitude below normal levels. During
   resting, if there is a deviation from this behavior a defect is detected
   While parametric rest of electric current has always been popular
   (including in bipolar and NMOS technologies) to detect short between
   power supply lines, the promise of IDDQ test is that it rc ill also
   allow detection of bridging between signal nets and transistor stuck-on
   faults in CMOS circuits. However; in reality the resolution of the size
   of the defect is limited by the magnitude of stand-by current. Since
   normal process variation can cause shift in stand-by current by two
   orders of magnitude, choosing a single threshold for IDDQ defect
   detection is impractical. Many ideas have been proposed to overcome this
   problem. most of which are based an choosing an adaptive cut-off point
   for a wafer; or a lot. In this paper, we suggest a technique, that in
   concept, is akin to setting an individual cut-off point for a die. The
   concept has been validated based on actual data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we have investigated a unified and simultaneous fault
   detection method for mixed-signal integrated circuits. The method is
   based on the analysis of the power-supply current through the circuit
   under test.
   The analysis has been done paying attention to the dynamic behaviour of
   the power-supply current, in order to avoid measurement problems related
   to the large amount of quiescent current drop across many analog blocks.
   The analysis of the dynamic power-supply current entails certain
   problems related to the complexity of the measurement process,
   especially those due to the high speed of the current transients. These
   problems have been addressed by considering a design for test procedure
   based on the use of built-in dynamic current sensors.
   The goal of the design for test methodology proposed is to represent the
   Iddt through the mixed-signal IC under test by a digital signature. The
   paper presents some advantages of this approach such as a good tolerance
   to crosstalk noise and the need for only a conventional digital tester
   on the complete mixed-signal IC for fault detection. The analysis is
   illustrated with some test results.}},
