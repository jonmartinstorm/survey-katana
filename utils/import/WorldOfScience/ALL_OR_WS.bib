Abstract = {{Since fault injection attack can be utilized to corrupt the data or
   deduce the secret key of sensitive information, we approach the fault
   detection design of confidential real-time applications running on Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPSs) to resist fault injection attacks. We choose
   cryptographic service to implement confidentiality protection for
   messages delivered over distributed CPSs, and deploy fault detection
   within confidential algorithm to resist fault injection attacks. We
   establish the fault dispersion model and the fault coverage model of ten
   fault detection schemes to quantify the security strength. We formulate
   the design problem as a system-level multi-objective optimization
   problem and then make efforts to search for the best fault detection
   schemes for the encryption/decryption of messages with the constraints
   of deadline and execution dependency.We propose an efficient approach
   based on traditional multi-objective evolutionary mechanisms, which can
   obtain better solutions with lower time complexity. Extensive
   experiments and a real-life application are conducted to evaluate the

Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of industrial control systems and the diversity of
   protocols in networks, it is difficult to build intrusion detection
   models based on network characteristics and physical modeling. In order
   to build a better flow model without additional knowledge, we propose an
   intrusion detection method based on the content of network packets. The
   construction of the model is based on the idea of ZOE method. The
   similarity between flows is calculated through the sequential coverage
   algorithm, the normal flow model is established by multi-layered
   clustering algorithm, and the Count-Mean-Min Sketch is used to store and
   count the flow model. By comparing the unknown flow with the constructed
   normal flow model, we achieve the intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS). The overall experimental results on 4 ICS datasets
   show that the improved method can effectively improve the detection rate
   and reduce the false-positive rate. The detection rate reached 96.7\% on
   average, and the false-positive rate reached 0.7\% on average.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the industrial control system (ICS) plays a vital role in
   critical infrastructures like the power grid. However, there is an
   increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to
   malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack
   would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this
   paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to
   mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take
   advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets
   include register status values that are used to reflect the physical
   characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states
   to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial
   networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register
   state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite
   automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS
   attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device
   fingerprints, including passive and active detection. We present a
   prototype of the iFinger and conduct real-world experiments to validate
   its performance. Results show that our approach achieves 97.1\% F1 score
   in ICS device identification. Furthermore, we simulate two typical ICS
   attacks (replacement and code modification) to validate the
   effectiveness of our iFinger in industrial networks. Our device
   fingerprints would detect those malicious attacks within 2s latency at
   98.0\% recall.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE}},

Abstract = {{The merging of power grid, information, and communication technology
   promotes the intelligent development of smart grid, which is also more
   prone to cyber attack threats. Especially, the intelligently designed

   paper, the graphical detection technology which uses Graph Network (GN)
   is developed for detecting tampered measurements without external

   detection of FDI attacks location issue from the diversified
   dimensionality in power systems, the Capsule Network combined with GN is
   developed, which can extract preserve the detailed properties around
   each note such as location, direction, connection, etc. To evaluate the
   superior performance of proposed method, the proposed detection
   technology is carried out through standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus
   systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   detect FDI attacks accurately with different attack sparsity and

Abstract = {{In this article, an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) is utilized
   for monitoring critical events such as structural equipment conditions
   in industrial environments. Such a system can easily be a point of
   attraction for the cyberattackers, in addition to system faults, severe
   resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy), and environmental
   problems. This makes data collection in the ICPS untrustworthy, even the
   data are altered after the data forwarding. Without validating this
   before data aggregation, detection of an event through the aggregation
   in the ICPS can be difficult. This article introduces TrustData, a
   scheme for high-quality data collection for event detection in the ICPS,
   referred to as ``Trust worthy and secured Data collection{''} scheme. It
   alleviates authentic data for accumulation at groups of sensor devices
   in the ICPS. Based on the application requirements, a reduced quantity
   of data is delivered to an upstream node, say, a cluster head. We
   consider that these data might have sensitive information, which is
   vulnerable to being altered before/after transmission. The contribution
   of this article is threefold. First, we provide the concept of TrustData
   to verify whether or not the acquired data are trustworthy (unaltered)
   before transmission, and whether or not the transmitted data are secured
   (data privacy is preserved) before aggregation. Second, we utilize a
   general measurement model that helps to verify acquired signal
   untrustworthy before transmitting toward upstream nodes. Finally, we
   provide an extensive performance analysis through a real-world dataset,
   and our results prove the effectiveness of TrustData.}},

Title = {{An energy-aware cyber physical system for energy Big data analysis and
   recessive production anomalies detection in discrete manufacturing
   workshops}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{With the development of sensing and communications technology, some new
   features have emerged in manufacturing processes, such as highly
   correlated, deeply integrated, dynamically integrated, and a huge volume
   of data. There is a strong need to deeply excavate information from
   manufacturing Big Data, especially the energy consumption data, for
   energy-efficient manufacturing operations management and analysis.
   However, relevant data reduction and association analysis to support
   energy-efficient manufacturing are still ineffective and error-prone,
   especially for discrete manufacturing workshops. In this paper, an
   energy-aware Cyber Physical System (E-CPS) is proposed for energy Big
   Data analysis and recessive production anomalies detection. Firstly,
   E-CPS is introduced to acquire manufacturing Big Data. Then, a Big Data
   analysis method, including data reduction and data association analysis,
   is proposed to analyse the manufacturing data in the E-CPS. Considering
   the complexity and dynamics of manufacturing processes, an energy Big

Abstract = {{A cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry
   4.0. It is an integrated system that merges computing, sensors, and
   actuators, controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrate people
   and cyberspace. However, CPS performance is limited by its computational
   complexity. Finding a way to implement CPS with reduced complexity while
   incorporating more efficient diagnostics, forecasting, and equipment
   health management in a real-time performance remains a challenge.
   Therefore, the study proposes an integrative machine-learning method to
   reduce the computational complexity and to improve the applicability as
   a virtual subsystem in the CPS environment. This study utilizes random
   forest (RF) and a time-series deep-learning model based on the long
   short-term memory (LSTM) networking to achieve real-time monitoring and
   to enable the faster corrective adjustment of machines. We propose a
   method in which a fault detection alarm is triggered well before a
   machine fails, enabling shop-floor engineers to adjust its parameters or
   perform maintenance to mitigate the impact of its shutdown. As
   demonstrated in two empirical studies, the proposed method outperforms
   other times-series techniques. Accuracy reaches 80\% or higher 3 h prior
   to real-time shutdown in the first case, and a significant improvement
   in the life of the product (281\%) during a particular process appears
   in the second case. The proposed method can be applied to other complex
   systems to boost the efficiency of machine utilization and productivity.}},

Abstract = {{For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced
   failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is
   creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively
   under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and
   validation can be carried out efficiently. Existing acceleration
   techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities
   beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects
   making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In
   this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to
   address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment
   interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to
   significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this
   observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced
   failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced
   acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and
   sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect
   structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM
   testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and
   can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of
   some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be
   carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower
   temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most
   significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is
   the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled
   environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that
   are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The
   simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce
   the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about
   10(5)x acceleration) under the 150 degrees C temperature limit, which is
   sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a hybrid intelligent-classic control approach for
   reconstruction and compensation of cyber attacks launched on inputs of
   nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS) and industrial Internet of Things
   systems, which work through shared communication networks. In this
   article, a class of n-order nonlinear systems is considered as a model
   of CPS while it is in presence of cyber attacks only in the forward
   channel. An intelligent-classic control system is developed to
   compensate cyber-attacks. Neural network (NN) is designed as an
   intelligent estimator for attack estimation and a classic nonlinear
   control system based on the variable structure control method is
   designed to compensate the effect of attacks and control the system
   performance in tracking applications. In the proposed strategy,
   nonlinear control theory is applied to guarantee the stability of the
   system when attacks happen. In this strategy, a Gaussian radial basis
   function NN is used for online estimation and reconstruction of
   cyber-attacks launched on the networked system. An adaptation law of the
   intelligent estimator is derived from a Lyapunov function. Simulation
   results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed
   strategy in car cruise control application as the testbed.}},

Abstract = {{A series of isostructural lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs),

   (4), Gd (5), Nd (6) and Tb(7); H(4)bptc = 2,3,3',4'-biphenyl

   tetracarboxylic acid. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals
   that all CPs featured a two dimensional (2D) layer with (6, 6,
   6)-connected 6(3) topology. Luminescent spectra demonstrate that CPs 1-7
   exhibit impressive UV-visible luminescence in the solid state at room
   temperature. More significantly, a single-component white-light material
   with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of
   (0.335, 0.334) for 4 (Sm-CP), very closing to the purewhite-light of
   (0.333, 0.333) was obtained by finely tuning of the excitation
   wavelength. In addition, the luminescent detection for anions of 7 is
   investigated. Fluorescence measurements show that 7 can detect oxoanion
   pollutants Cr2O72-, CrO42-, and MnO4- anions in aqueous solutions with
   high selectivity and sensitivity, which suggests that the Tb-CP is a
   promising functional luminescence probe for toxic oxoanions. The

Abstract = {{The usage of machine learning techniques is widely spread and has also
   been implemented in the wind industry in the last years. Many of these
   techniques have shown great success but need to constantly prove the
   expectation of functionality. This paper describes a new method to
   monitor the health of a wind turbine using an undercomplete autoencoder.
   To evaluate the health monitoring quality of the autoencoder, the number
   of anomalies before an event has happened are to be considered. The
   results show that around 35\% of all historical events that have
   resulted into a failure show many anomalies. Furthermore, the wind
   turbine subsystems which are subject to good detectability are the rotor
   system and the control system. If only one third of the service duties
   can be planned in advance, and thereby the scheduling time can be
   reduced, huge cost saving potentials can be seen.}},

Abstract = {{Due to tremendous growth in the network, security is a major concern and
   it is gaining a high level of attention in the system. In the Industrial
   control systems such as SCADA wind turbines, intruders target to corrupt
   information by making traffic. A Novel method known as Mesh Intruder
   detachment scheme has proposed to overcome such influential attacks.
   Enhanced intrusion detection based traffic optimization and deep
   learning based neural network algorithm are used to detect delay and
   passage caused by the intruders. The proposed scheme acts in two phases.
   In the first phase, redundant information such as unwanted distortions,
   frequency specification changes was removed and selected features were
   extracted for optimization. In the second phase, an Interruption attack
   has been detected and labeled which causes damage to the growth of
   production.}},

Abstract = {{In connection with anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, we
   suggest in this paper a new way of modelling large systems consisting of
   a huge number of sensors, actuators and controllers. We base the
   approach on analytical methods usually used in kinetic gas theory, where
   one tries to describe the overall behavior of a gas without looking at
   each molecule separately. We model the system as a multi-agent network
   and derive predictions on the behavior of the network as a whole. These
   predictions can then be used to monitor the operation of the system. If
   the deviation between the predictions and the measured attributes of the
   operational cyber-physical system is sufficiently large, the monitoring
   system can raise an alarm. This way of modelling the normal behavior of
   a cyber-physical system has the advantage over machine learning methods
   mainly used for this purpose, that it is not based on the effective
   operation of the system during a training phase, but rather on the
   specification of the system and its intended use. It will detect
   anomalies in the system's operation independent of their source-may it
   be an attack, a malfunction or a faulty implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the sensor attack detection and isolation
   problems for cyber-physical systems under attacked situation. To begin
   with, an overall system is constructed for the network of dynamic system
   and all the issues are dealt with for the overall system instead of
   every subsystem. Then, we prove that the preconditions which are made on
   the original subsystem can be transferred on to the overall system.
   After this, for the overall system, a sliding mode observer that is
   robust to the disturbance but sensitive to the sensor attack is designed
   as sensor attack detector to issue an alarm when at least one subsystem
   is attacked. In addition, we cope with the sensor fault isolation
   problem by building an augmented descriptor system for the overall
   system and we further prove that the precondition can be kept for the
   augmented descriptor system. Then, another robust sliding mode observer
   is designed to reach the goal of attack isolation. Finally, a simulation
   example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

   Devices: Smart-Grid Case}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical
   infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The
   emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure
   that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase
   efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised
   devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges.
   Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid
   information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral
   detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart
   grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,
   we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify
   compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and
   function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical
   analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral
   characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a
   realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both
   resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our
   framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device
   scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of
   our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting
   compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call
   tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate
   for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance
   metrics include accuracy values between 95\% and 99\% for the different
   attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that
   the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid
   devices' computing resources.}},

Title = {{Optimal periodic watermarking schedule for replay attack detection in
   cyber-physical systems}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We consider periodic watermarking scheduling for detecting discontinuous
   replay attacks in Cyber- Physical Systems (CPSs). The existing methods
   of imposing continuous watermarks on the nominal control inputs may
   result in the waste of control cost when system detectors are not
   sensitive to the added watermarks, since the attacker may be absent for
   a considerably long time. For example, in the famous Stuxnet event, the
   attacker only launches the attack for a short period each month in order
   to avoid being detected. In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time
   attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by
   exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy
   which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal
   periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection
   performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Abstract = {{The preeminent challenge when data is compiled from cyber-physical
   system is the detection and filtering of faulty data. When the storage,
   processing, and communication of a reasonable amount of data migrate to
   those mobile and embedded devices, it becomes strenuous to apply
   conventional powerful algorithms for identifying, eliminating, and
   tolerating the faulty data because of the resource constraints of these
   devices. Further, the real-time requirements of CPS applications require
   CPSs to respond quickly and the aggregation method that is
   long-established in CPSs makes it challenging to ascertain the value of
   the original data. Thus, a systematic approach is essential to
   accomplish the goal of faulty data detection and filtering. In this
   paper, we present several approaches that we can deploy to detect and
   filter faulty data efficiently and cost-effectively, to improve the
   quality of the collected data from a system's perspective to match the

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a prevailing area of research for several years,
   and numerous intrusion detection systems have been proposed for
   industrial control systems (ICS). In recent ages, the attacks like
   seismic net, duqu and flame against ICS infrastructures have instigated
   great harm to nuclear infrastructures and precarious facilities in
   several nations. The authors outline an approach to detect
   intrusions/anomalies in K'S. A method is presented to detect intrusions
   in real-time and automatically. The existing techniques are normally
   designed for open systems and protocols, that lacks adequate
   generalisation and resistance to acclimate to other networks, and they
   have either short detection rote or tall rate of false positive. This
   Letter presents a network packet contents behaviour and bidirectional
   Gated Recurrent Units-based method to detect intrusions in a timely and
   efficient manner. The method has proven a robust method of classifying
   intmsions/anomalies in a proficient way. Through extensive evaluation on
   an actual huge scale dataset spawned from SCADA-based gas pipeline
   network, the proposed method shows significant performance enhancement
   and outclasses the standard state-of-the-art methods with 98.68\% rate
   of accuracy. Moreover, it is also able to detect zero-day (unseen)

Abstract = {{The False data injection attack (FDIA) against the Cyber-Physical Power
   System (CPPS) is a kind of data integrity attack. With more and more
   cyber vulnerabilities detected out, different types of FDIAs are
   emerging as severe threats to the stable operation of CPPS gradually. In
   this paper, the invasion pathway of the FDIA against CPPS is explored in
   detail, and a novel FDIA detection model based on ensemble learning is
   further provided. First, a pseudo-sample database is built to assist the
   training and evaluation of this model, and it \& x2019;s more important
   to update the model in the future. Furthermore, the optimal feature set
   is extracted to characterize the behavior of the FDIA, which improves
   the precision of the FDIA detection model. Finally, a
   focal-loss-lightgbm (FLGB) ensemble classifier is constructed to detect
   the FDIA behavior automatically and accurately. We illustrated the
   performance of this model by a fusion of measurement data and power
   system audit logs. This model utilizes the offline training way, the
   conclusion shows the high precision and stability of this model, which
   ensures the stable operation of the smart grid and improves the FDIA
   resistance ability of the CPPS.}},

Title = {{Multivariate Abnormal Detection for Industrial Control Systems Using 1D
   CNN and GRU}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{88348-88359}},
Abstract = {{Currently, most anomaly detection approaches in industrial control
   systems (ICSs) use network event logs to build models, and current
   unsupervised machine learning methods rarely use spatiotemporal
   correlations and other dependencies between multiple variables
   (sensors/actuators) in a system to detect anomalies. Most of the
   existing anomaly detection technologies simply compare the current
   states with the predicted normal range. Due to the highly dynamic
   characteristic of industrial control systems, it is insufficient to
   simply compare the current states with the predicted normal range. As a
   result, these approaches have low detection rates for unknown or new
   types of attacks. In view of these shortcomings, this paper presents a
   network model for predicting sensor/controller parameters in industrial
   control systems. To predict the parameter values of the sensors and
   controllers more accurately, the 1D convolutional neural network (1D \&
   x005F;CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are combined to fully learn
   the spatiotemporal correlation and other dependencies between the
   parameter values of the sensors and controllers at each moment. An
   abnormal state detection method based on the calculation of the
   statistical deviation is proposed to realize the anomaly detection of
   industrial control systems. The model is validated on the Secure Water
   Treatment (SWaT) dataset. The precision, recall and F1 scores are used
   to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in anomaly detection on the
   SWaT dataset. The experimental results show that the average precision
   and recall of this method are 0.99 and 0.85, respectively, and that the
   average F1 score is 0.91. The experimental results show that the
   proposed method can be successfully applied to anomaly detection systems
   in industrial control systems with lower false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of the cyber-physical system (CPS) into power systems
   has created a variety of communication requirements and functions that
   existing legacy systems do not support. To this end, the IEEE 1815.1
   standard defines the mapping between existing distributed network
   protocol networks and IEC 61850 networks that reflect new requirements.
   However, advanced CPS cyberattacks have been reported, and in order to
   address cyberattacks, security research on new power systems that use
   network devices and heterogeneous communication is necessary. In this
   study, we propose an intrusion detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based
   power system using CPS. We 1) analyze an IEEE 1815.1-based power system
   network and propose a suitable application method for an intrusion
   detection system, 2) suggest a bidirectional recurrent neural
   network-based anomaly detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based network,
   and 3) demonstrate the verification of the proposed technique using
   various power system-specific attack data, including real power system
   using CPS network traffic, CPS malware behavior (CMB), false data
   injection (FDI), and disabling reassembly (DR) attacks. Proposed
   technique successfully detected five types of CMB attacks, three types

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Pages = {{74933-74942}},
Abstract = {{With the development of the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems(CPSS), a large
   number of multidimensional time series have been generated in today \&
   x2019;s world, such as: sensor data for industrial equipment operation,
   vehicle driving data, and cloud server operation and maintenance data
   and so on. The key task of Cloud \& x2013;Fog \& x2013;Edge Computing in
   managing these systems is how to detect anomalous data in a specific
   time series to facilitate operator action to solve potential system
   problems. So multidimensional time series outlier detection become an
   important direction of CPSS data mining and Cloud \& x2013;Fog \&
   x2013;Edge Computing research, and it has a wide range of applications
   in industry, finance, medicine and other fields. This paper proposes a
   framework called Multidimensional time series Outlier detection based on
   a Time Convolutional Network AutoEncoder (MOTCN-AE), which can detect
   outliers in time series data, such as identifying equipment failures,
   dangerous driving behaviors of cars, etc. Specifically, this paper first
   uses a feature extraction method to transform the original time series
   into a feature-rich time series. Second, the proposed TCN-AE is used to
   reconstruct the feature-rich time series data, and the reconstruction
   error is used to calculate outlier scores. Finally, the MOTCN-AE
   framework is validated by multiple time series datasets to demonstrate
   its effectiveness in detecting time series outliers.}},

Abstract = {{The cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs) is becoming

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) can be defined by the
   integration of control, network communication, and computing with a
   physical manufacturing process. In this work, we present a hybrid model
   of CPMS combining sensor data, context information, and expert
   knowledge. We used the identification of global operational states and a
   multimodel framework to improve anomaly detection and diagnosis. The
   anomaly detection is based on context-sensitive adaptive threshold
   limits. Root cause diagnosis is based on classification models and
   expert knowledge. The proposed approach was implemented using the
   Internet of Things (IoT) to extract data from a computer numerical
   control machine. Results showed that using a context-sensitive modeling
   strategy allowed to combine physics-based and data-driven models for
   residual analysis to detect an anomaly in the part, machine, or process.
   The identification of root cause was improved by adding context
   information in classification models to identify worn or broken tools
   and wrong material. Note to Practitioners-Anomaly detection and
   diagnosis of manufacturing equipment is a complex problem. Some of the
   challenges are complex machine dynamics and nonstationary operating
   conditions. This paper describes a framework for modeling manufacturing
   equipment using a combination of sensor data, context information, and
   system knowledge. The proposed modeling framework is used to improve
   anomaly detection for diagnostics using a context-sensitive strategy.
   This work aims to support more effective maintenance actions by
   identifying problems in the machine, part, or process. The modeling and
   anomaly detection strategy was used to identify anomalies in computer
   numerical control machines and can be extended to other equipment on the
   plant floor.}},

Abstract = {{To improve productivity and efficiency in industrial manufacturing, the
   fourth industrial revolution leads to the implementation of Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) in the industrial
   environment. Ubiquitous communication makes CPS susceptible to external
   influences, which can have a negative intention; for instance, CPS are
   prone to various attacks and malicious threats by different adversaries.
   The impact of an attack on the system can lead to anomalies and serious
   consequences for system parts or the system as a whole. Security
   mechanisms must be developed in order to timely detect different attacks
   and to keep the system safe and protected. In this paper, a method for
   sensor signal attacks detection in a continuous time controlled systems
   has been proposed. The method is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   and tested on the data obtained from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)

Abstract = {{The complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) opens up several
   challenges regarding the assurance of high levels of reliability.
   Therefore, we need to develop a new data quality analysis and new CPS
   components/subsystems for the detection, isolation, recovery, and
   prevention of failures and intrusion events. Furthermore, we have to
   develop new reliability assessment models and metrics in order to
   properly evaluate CPSs. Agent technologies, through their
   characteristics such as autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and
   proactivity, have the potential to address these challenges and
   requirements. We propose a multi-agent based solution, namely ReliaCPS,
   for detecting and preventing the failures of the system components of
   CPSs. We also use a case study of a CPS for monitoring ambient
   parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Our
   results indicate improvements in terms of reliability metrics (32.69\%
   for the mean time between failures and mean time to failure, 50\% for
   the mean time to repair and 0.94\% for reliability function over time).}},

Title = {{A Two Stage Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Control Networks
   Based on Ethernet/IP}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 and the TCP/IP protocol suite) is
   gradually applied in industrial control system (ICS) with the
   development of information technology. It breaks the natural isolation
   of ICS, but contains no security mechanisms. An improved intrusion
   detection system (IDS), which is strongly correlated to specific
   industrial scenarios, is necessary for modern ICS. On one hand, this
   paper outlines three kinds of attack models, including infiltration
   attacks, creative forging attacks, and false data injection attacks. On
   the other hand, a two stage IDS is proposed, which contains a traffic
   prediction model and an anomaly detection model. The traffic prediction
   model, which is based on the autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA), can forecast the traffic of the ICS network in the short term
   and detect infiltration attacks precisely according to the abnormal
   changes in traffic patterns. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model,
   using a one class support vector machine (OCSVM), is able to detect
   malicious control instructions by analyzing the key field in Ethernet/IP
   packets. The confusion matrix is selected to testify to the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and two other innovative IDSs are
   used for comparison. The experiment results show that the proposed two
   stage IDS in this paper has an outstanding performance in detecting
   infiltration attacks, forging attacks, and false data injection attacks
   compared with other IDSs.}},

Title = {{Unscented Kalman Filter based interval state estimation of cyber
   physical energy system for detection of dynamic attack}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICTs) introduce many
   Internet-based entry points that pose potential risks to cyber physical
   energy system (CPES). Therefore, it is significant to enhance the
   cybersecurity of CPES from cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new dynamic
   attack model that takes into account the dynamic characteristics of
   energy systems is developed based on traditional false data injection
   attack. The proposed attack model can be used to describe the attack
   behaviors of a malicious attacker over time. Then, we propose a new
   generalized interval state estimator to quantify the normal fluctuations
   of all CPES state variables. In this state estimator, the Unscented
   Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to predict the real-time operating level of
   the state variables. Copula theory is introduced to model the prediction
   uncertainty of sustainable energy and load as a set of conditional
   quantiles. We then model the normal fluctuation range of each CPES state
   as a bilevel nonlinear programming problem based on the worst case
   analysis. Consequently, an anomaly detection method is developed to
   detect whether there is an attack or not in the CPES. In this method,
   any state variable that falls outside its estimated interval is
   considered an abnormal point. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic
   attack model and the effectiveness of the anomaly detection method have
   been extensively validated on test systems in power and energy society
   of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). (C)

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease is one of the notable neurodegenerative disorders
   caused by insufficient production of dopamine which damages the motor
   skills and voice. Advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has
   fuelled the development of healthcare systems. In this article, we
   propose an intelligent system for detecting Parkinson's disease to
   provide proper medication by analysing voice samples. Instead of relying
   on limited storage capacity and computational resources of IoT, the
   recent healthcare systems take advantages of the cloud server. On the
   other hand, the utilization of cloud computing incurs the issues of data
   privacy and additional communication costs to the healthcare systems. To
   address this issue, we propose to utilize Fog computing as a midway
   layer between end devices and the cloud server. The proposed system
   employs the combinatorial Fuzzy K-nearest Neighbor and Case-based
   Reasoning classifier for the better classification of the Parkinson
   patients from healthy individuals. On the detection of abnormality, the
   proposed healthcare system is designed to generate an immediate alert to
   the patient. The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on the
   UCI-Parkinson dataset, and the results reveal the improved performance
   of our system over baseline approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection and prevention system detects malicious activities
   that occur in the real-time SCADA systems. This system has a problem
   without a profound solution. The challenge of the existing intrusion

   detection system is used for detecting the intrusion with encrypted
   date, time, and file location with less false-positive and
   false-negative rates and thereby preventing the SCADA system from
   further intrusion. It is done in three phases. First, Modified Grey Wolf
   Optimization (MGWO) is used to extract the features needed for
   classification and to find the best weight. Second, Entropy-based
   Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) is used to extort the features and
   detect the intruded data with its intruded time, file location, and

Abstract = {{Ice accretion on wind turbine blades is one of the major faults
   affecting the operational safety and power generation efficiency of wind
   turbines. Current icing detection methods are based on either
   meteorological observing system or extra condition monitoring system.
   Compared with current methods, icing detection using the intrinsic
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines
   has plenty of potential advantages, such as low cost, high stability,
   and early icing detection ability. However, there have not been deep
   investigations in this field at present. In this paper, a novel
   intelligent wind turbine blade icing detection method based on the wind
   turbine SCADA data is proposed. This method consists of three processes:
   SCADA data preprocessing, automatic feature extraction, and ensemble
   icing detection model construction. Specifically, deep autoencoders
   network is employed to learn multilevel fault features from the complex
   SCADA data adaptively. And the ensemble technique is utilized to make
   full use of all the extracted features from different hidden layers of
   the deep autoencoders network to build the ensemble icing detection
   model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the
   data collected from actual wind farms. The experimental results reveal
   that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively extract valuable
   fault features from the complex SCADA data, but also obtains higher
   detection accuracy and generalization capability compared with
   conventional machine learning models and individual deep learning model.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted
   integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan
   detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is
   masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome
   the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based
   on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the
   different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed
   Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are
   used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random
   side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by
   the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the
   suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the
   embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about
   250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by
   using the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding potential behaviors of attackers is of paramount
   importance for improving the cybersecurity of power systems. However,
   the attack behaviors in existing studies are often modeled statically on
   a single snapshot, which neglects the reality of a dynamically
   time-evolving power system. Accordingly, a dynamic cyber-attack model
   with local network information is proposed to characterize the typical
   data injection attack with the integration of potential dynamic
   behaviors of an attacker. The proposed model collaboratively alters the
   meter measurement in a stealthy way to illegally contaminate the system
   state, thus posing severe threats to cyber physical power systems. We
   then develop a novel anomaly detection countermeasure from the
   perspective of state estimation to effectively recognize the dynamic
   injection attack. In this countermeasure, an interval state forecasting
   method is proposed to approximate the possible largest variation bounds
   of each state variable based on a worst-case analysis considering the
   forecasting uncertainties of renewable energy sources, electric loads,
   and network parameter perturbations. In addition, the kernel quantile
   regression is introduced and implemented to formulate the uncertainties
   in renewable energy and electric load forecast as a series of confidence
   intervals. When any state variable falls outside its preforecasted
   intervals, the proposed countermeasure detects the anomaly and sets an
   alarm condition indicating the possibility of data contamination.
   Finally, the results from our extensive studies on several IEEE standard
   test systems have been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   dynamic attack and the effectiveness of the detection countermeasure.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) security has become a critical research
   topic as more and more CPS applications are making increasing impacts in
   diverse industrial sectors. Due to the tight interaction between cyber
   and physical components, CPS security requires a different strategy from
   the traditional information technology (IT) security. In this paper, we
   propose a machine learning-based attack detection (AD) scheme, as part
   of our overall CPS security strategies. The proposed scheme performs AD
   at the physical layer by modeling and monitoring physics or physical
   behavior of the physical asset or process. In developing the proposed AD
   scheme, we devote our efforts on intelligently deriving salient
   signatures or features out of the large number of noisy physical
   measurements by leveraging physical knowledge and using advanced machine
   learning techniques. Such derived features not only capture the physical
   relationships among the measurements but also have more discriminant
   power in distinguishing normal and attack activities. In our
   experimental study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
   AD scheme, we consider heavy-duty gas turbines of combined cycle power
   plants as the CPS application. Using the data from both the
   high-fidelity simulation and several real plants, we demonstrate that
   our proposed AD scheme is effective in early detection of attacks or
   malicious activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with secure state estimation of cyber-physical systems
   subject to switching (on/off) attack signals and injection of fake
   packets (via either packet substitution or insertion of extra packets).
   The random set paradigm is adopted in order to model, via random finite
   sets (RFSs), the switching nature of both system attacks and the
   injection of fake measurements. The problem of detecting an attack on
   the system and jointly estimating its state, possibly in the presence of
   fake measurements, is then formulated and solved in the Bayesian
   framework for systems with and without direct feedthrough of the attack
   input to the output. This leads to the analytical derivation of a hybrid
   Bernoulli filter (HBF) that updates in real time the joint posterior
   density of a Bernoulli attack RFS and of the state vector. A closed-form
   Gaussian mixture implementation of the proposed HBF is fully derived in
   the case of invertible direct feedthrough. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the developed tools for joint attack detection and secure state
   estimation is tested on two case studies concerning a benchmark system
   for unknown input estimation and a standard IEEE power network
   application.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of attacks against cyberphysical systems in recent
   years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control
   systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly
   based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion

   motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack
   detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed
   utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process
   parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense
   in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable
   consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for
   demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS
   testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of
   service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data
   injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack
   and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four
   classical classification models based on network data and host system
   data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree,
   bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a
   secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that
   the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results
   suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm
   rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable
   detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be
   detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command
   tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored
   for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed
   detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied
   to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this
   approach detects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant
   consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack
   detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a
   promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.}},

Abstract = {{Most of prior hardware Trojan detection approaches require golden chips
   for references. A classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan
   detection technique has been proposed in the authors' previous work.
   However, the algorithm in that work is trained by simulated ICs without
   considering a shift between the simulation and silicon fabrication. In
   this study, a co-training based hardware Trojan detection method by
   exploiting inaccurate simulation models and unlabeled fabricated ICs is
   proposed to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated
   ICs, which eliminates the need of golden chips. Two classification
   algorithms are trained using simulated ICs. These two algorithms can
   identify different patterns in the unlabelled ICs during test-time, and
   thus can label some of these ICs for the further training of the other
   algorithm. Moreover, a statistical examination is used to choose ICs
   labelling for the other algorithm. A statistical confidence interval
   based technique is also used to combine the hypotheses of the two
   classification algorithms. Furthermore, the partial least squares method
   is used to preprocess the raw data of ICs for feature selection. Both
   EDA experiment results and field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   experiment results show that the proposed technique can detect unknown
   Trojans with high accuracy and recall.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures crucial to our modern life, such as electricity
   grids and water pumps, are controlled by Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Over the last two decades, connecting
   critical infrastructures to the Internet has become essential due to
   performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet
   connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact
   that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic
   of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address
   these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection
   techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern
   recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data
   transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for
   anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that
   unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the
   system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov
   Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the
   algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature
   extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different
   aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern
   recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction,
   can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate
   functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect. (C) 2019

Journal = {{SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{The Cypher Physical Power Systems (CPPS) became vital targets for
   intruders because of the large volume of high speed heterogeneous data
   provided from the Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS). The Nonnested
   Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate
   classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However,
   NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input
   features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders
   the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce
   VHDRA, a Vertical and Horizontal Data Reduction Approach, to improve the
   classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and reduce the
   computational resource consumption. VHDRA provides the following
   functionalities: (1) it vertically reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant features and by reducing the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles. (2) It horizontally reduces the size of data while
   preserving original key events and patterns within the datasets using an
   approach called STEM, State Tracking and Extraction Method. The
   experiments show that the overall performance of VHDRA using both the
   vertical and the horizontal reduction reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles
   by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves the accuracy of the NNGE
   by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\% using the Multi-, Binary, and Triple class

Abstract = {{Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) constitute complex and
   heterogeneous `system of systems' embracing the numerous advantages of
   traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The
   pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS
   broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised
   new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical
   attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place,
   unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability,
   that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a
   salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS.
   We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS
   under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined
   Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based
   communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the
   communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and
   localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an
   optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and
   security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present
   intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test

Abstract = {{Natural disaster is one of the most important research topics worldwide.
   In this paper, a data driven cyber-physical system is introduced to
   detect landslides. This system is composed of Wi-Sun acceleration
   sensors, which can detect the acceleration of the nearby environment in
   3D domain, and the sensors are linked with the router (act as `sink'
   node) via Wi-Sun transmission (i.e. IEEE802.15.4g). The details of the
   detection system are explained and the landslide detection mechanism
   with low computational complexity is proposed. A traffic reduction
   method is proposed thereafter to help reduce the data needed for
   transmission by exploring the intra-correlations of the sensor data.
   This method can save the energy consumption without degrading the
   detection performance. Field test is conducted and the results show that
   the landslide can be detected and amount of data to be transmitted can
   be reduced, which verifies the system's effectiveness.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{370-379}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Numerous intelligent fault diagnosis models have been developed on
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of wind
   turbines, so as to process massive SCADA data effectively and
   accurately. However, there is a problem ignored among these studies.
   That is, SCADA data distribution is imbalanced and the anomalous data
   mining is not sufficient. The amount of normal data is much more than
   that of abnormal data, which makes these models tend to be biased toward
   majority class, i.e., normal data, while accuracy of diagnosing fault is
   poor. Aimed at overcoming this problem, a novel intelligent fault
   diagnosis methodology is proposed based on exquisitely designed deep
   neural networks. The between-classes imbalance problem is handled by
   learning deep representation that can preserve within-class information
   and between-classes information based on triplet loss. The proposed
   method encourages a pair of data belonging to same class to be projected
   onto points as close as possible in new embedding space. It tries to
   enforce a margin between different class data. The effectiveness and
   generalization of the proposed method are validated on the SCADA data of
   two wind turbines containing blades icing accretion fault. The result
   demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the traditional normal
   behavior modeling method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the security problems in cyber-physical systems (CPSs)
   against replay attack are considered. With replay attacks, attacker
   records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and
   receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective
   for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed
   to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and
   compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method
   detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in
   normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are
   further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and
   output, respectively. Moreover, the output-based detector has more
   low-computing solution process than the residual-based one. Finally, a
   practical example is proposed to demonstrate the superiority of the
   stochastic coding scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Cyber-Physical System (ICPS) monitoring is increasingly being
   used to make decisions that impact the operation of the industry.
   Industrial manufacturing environments such as production lines are
   dynamic and evolve over time due to new requirements (new customer
   needs, conformance to standards, maintenance, etc.) or due to the
   anomalies detected. When an evolution happens (e.g., new devices are
   introduced), monitoring systems must be aware of it in order to inform
   the user and to provide updated and reliable information. In this
   article, CALENDAR is presented, a software module for a monitoring
   system that addresses ICPS evolutions. The solution is based on a data
   metamodel that captures the structure of an ICPS in different
   timestamps. By comparing the data model in two subsequent timestamps,
   CALENDAR is able to detect and effectively classify the evolution of
   ICPSs at runtime to finally generate alerts about the detected
   evolution. In order to evaluate CALENDAR with different ICPS topologies
   (e.g., different ICPS sizes), a scalability test was performed
   considering the information captured from the production lines domain.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a next-generation intelligent system
   integrating computing, communication, and control. As a unit of
   computing process and physical process, CPS is a new research field,
   where cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is not only a microcosm
   of CPS but also a prerequisite for unmanned systems. CACC relies on the
   wireless communication network technology to achieve cooperative
   platooning control through vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative control
   methods. It can improve traffic efficiency and ensure safe driving. Once
   the wireless network is introduced by each vehicle to exchange
   information, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks, making attack detection
   necessary. In this paper, an integral sliding mode observer is designed
   to monitor malicious attacks. The proposed sliding mode observer not
   only retains the performance of traditional sliding mode control but
   also realizes the finite-time observation, avoiding the singular
   phenomenon that may occur in the traditional terminal sliding mode.

Abstract = {{In the harsh environmental conditions of cyber-physical systems (CPSs),
   the consensus problem seems to be one of the central topics that affect
   the performance of consensus-based applications, such as events
   detection, estimation, tracking, blockchain, etc. In this paper, we
   investigate the events detection based on consensus problem of CPS by
   means of compressed sensing (CS) for applications such as attack
   detection, industrial process monitoring, automatic alert system, and
   prediction for potentially dangerous events in CPS. The edge devices in
   a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local
   observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to
   iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The
   information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of
   jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus
   algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal
   decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region
   and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors.
   Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster
   partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network
   lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a
   global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm
   can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower
   transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The electric power system infrastructure has begun to adopt digital
   information technologies such as transmission control protocol/internet
   protocol (TCP/IP) and Ethernet infrastructures. With this adoption,
   information technology-centric network and system management (NSM) tools
   are used to manage the intermediate communication systems and electric
   devices in digital substations. However, the technology to monitor the
   cyber-physical System (CPS) statistics for the intelligent electronic
   devices (IEDs) and serial communication for a digital substation does
   not exist yet. In this paper, we aim to propose cyber-physical analysis
   methodologies of a digital substation system, concerning issues of (1)
   International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62351-7 based network
   and system management, (2) behavior analysis of the CPS, (3)
   cyber-physical anomaly detection systems, and (4) a testbed for a
   digital substation. By collaborating with Electric Power Research
   Institute (EPRI), a cyber security testbed for the digital substation
   has been developed to implement the use cases and analyze potential
   security threats. Newly integrated methodologies for information

Abstract = {{To reduce the excessive power consumption and eliminate the battery
   voltage imbalance caused in conventional method, a novel broken line
   detection scheme for Li-ion battery protection integrated circuits (ICs)
   is presented in this study. The main part of the proposed circuit

   control switch and a bias current source. A narrow pulse control signal
   is adopted to trigger broken line detection periodically so as to
   suppress the detection current consumption, while the disadvantage of
   battery voltage imbalance is overcome. The proposed circuit has been
   implemented in a seven cells Li-ion battery protection IC with 0.18 mu m
   45 V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process successfully. The experimental results
   confirm that the chip can reliably detect the disconnections of Li-ion
   batteries and take protective measures in a wide cell voltage range from
   2.2 to 4.2 V. Furthermore, based on the derivation in this study, the
   proposed technique can significantly reduce the detection current

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a frequency-based approach for the detection of
   replay attacks affecting cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular,
   the method employs a sinusoidal signal with a time-varying frequency
   (authentication signal) into the closed-loop system and checks whether
   the time profile of the frequency components in the output signal are
   compatible with the authentication signal or not. In order to carry out
   this target, the couplings between inputs and outputs are eliminated
   using a dynamic decoupling technique based on vector fitting. In this
   way, a signature introduced on a specific input channel will affect only
   the output that is selected to be associated with that input, which is a
   property that can be exploited to determine which channels are being
   affected. A bank of band-pass filters is used to generate signals whose
   energies can be compared to reconstruct an estimation of the
   time-varying frequency profile. By matching the known frequency profile
   with its estimation, the detector can provide the information about
   whether a replay attack is being carried out or not. The design of the
   signal generator and the detector are thoroughly discussed, and an
   example based on a quadruple-tank process is used to show the
   application and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection
   against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits
   (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly
   published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the
   electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip
   area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that
   is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in
   one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out
   in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving
   the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the
   measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept
   implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs
   under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the
   user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab
   equipment in short amount of time.}},

   5-n-butoxyisophthalate, (i)BuOip = 5-i-butoxyisophthalate, bpp =
   1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane), were synthesized from 5-substituted
   isophthalate ligands using the 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) ligand.
   Topology analysis indicated that compound 1 showed a 3D lvt topology,
   whereas compound 2 showed a two-fold interpenetrated 3D diamond network.
   Complexes 3 and 4 exhibited 2D sql/Shubnikov tetragonal plane networks.
   The coordination polymers were distinguished by the 5-substituted groups
   of isophthalate and the conformation of bpp. Moreover, compounds 2-4 are
   bifunctional luminescent materials that can detect environmentally
   relevant Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions using a luminescence quenching method.
   The detection limits of CPs 2-4 for Fe3+ were 6.676 x 10(-5) M, 5.442 x
   10(-5) M, and 1.773 x 10(-5) M, respectively, whereas the detection
   limits of CPs 2-4 for Cr2O72- were 0.1314 x 10(-5) M, 1.778 x 10(-5) M,
   and 1.676 x 10(-5) M, respectively. The possible mechanisms for the
   fluorescence quenching phenomenon toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions have also

Abstract = {{Cyber Physical System (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry
   4.0. CPS is an integrated system that combines computing, sensors and
   actuators. CPS is controlled by computer-based algorithms that
   integrates people and internet. However, the performance of CPS is
   limited by its computational complexity. How to implement CPS with less
   computational complexity in a real time performance remains an important
   issue. Therefore, the study attempts to establish a CPS based on machine
   learning to reduce its complexity and improve applicability. This study
   applies a Fault Detection and Classification system (FDC) with machine
   learning method in the virtual subsystem of CPS. This study consists of
   two steps. Based on the data collected from sensors of CPS, Random
   Forest (RF) is used to figure out key factors that reduces the data
   dimension for less computational complexity. The process engineers will
   know which factors are causing the machine fails. The second step is to
   establish a time series model which bases on Long Short-Term Memory
   (LSTM) network to achieve real time monitoring of the machine. Before
   the machine fails, FDC will alarm that allow the engineer to adjust
   parameters of machines to avoid machine fails. The study in order to
   achieve the goals of predicting machines fails, figuring out key
   factors, predicting maintenance and increasing the productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing interaction of modern industrial control systems (ICS) to
   the outside Internet world influences making these systems vulnerable to
   a wide range of cyber-attacks. Moreover, the utilisation of
   Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products, as well as open communication
   protocols, made them attractive targets to various threat agents
   including cyber-criminals, national-state, and cyber-terrorists. Given
   that, today's ICSs are deriving the most critical national
   infrastructures. Therefore, this raises tremendous needs to secure these
   systems against cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology has been
   considered as one of the most essential security precautions for ICS
   networks. It can effectively detect potential cyber-attacks and

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems are found often in industrial sectors and
   critical infrastructures to monitor and control industrial processes.
   Recently, the security of industrial control systems has gained much
   attention as these systems now exhibit an increased interaction with the
   Internet. In fact, classical SCADA systems are already lacking with
   security problems, and with the increased interconnectivity to the
   Internet, they are now exposed to new types of threats and
   cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most
   important security solutions used today in industrial control systems to
   detect potential attacks and malicious activities. This paper summarizes
   previous work for Intrusion Detection Systems approaches in Industrial
   Control Systems and highlights challenges and opportunities in
   implementing such solutions. We believe that such insights are valuable
   for further research in the industrial security context.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are becoming more integral to modern
   life as they are being integrated into critical infrastructure. These
   systems typically lack application layer encryption and the placement of
   common network intrusion services have large blind spots. We propose the
   novel architecture, Cloud Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention
   System (CB-IDPS), to detect and prevent threats in ICS networks by using
   software defined networking (SDN) to route traffic to the cloud for
   inspection using network function virtualization (NFV) and service
   function chaining. CB-IDPS uses Amazon Web Services to create a virtual
   private cloud for packet inspection. The CB-IDPS framework is designed
   with considerations to the ICS delay constraints, dynamic traffic
   routing, scalability, resilience, and visibility. CB-IDPS is presented
   in the context of a micro grid energy management system as the test case
   to prove that the latency of CB-IDPS is within acceptable delay
   thresholds. The implementation of CB-IDPS uses the OpenDaylight software
   for the SDN controller and commonly used network security tools such as
   Zeek and Snort. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using NFV
   in an ICS context for network security.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effect of replay attacks on constrained
   cyber-physical systems which are subject to linear probabilistic
   constraints. In order to inject an exogenous control input without being
   detected the attacker will hijack the sensors, observe and record their
   readings for a certain amount of time and repeat them afterwards while
   carrying out his attack. The conditions under which the attacker can
   induce perturbation in the control loop without being detected is
   studied. Then, in order to make the system resilient to the replay
   attack, a random signal (serving as the authentication signal) is added
   to the control input. Since this signal can hamper the performance of
   the system, finally, the optimization of the authentication signals is
   proposed to maximize the detection rate while keeping the process
   deterioration bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is
   demonstrated on a simulated case study.}},

Abstract = {{In most of our daily lives, we observe repetitive (periodic) movements
   of our surrounding objects. In physiotherapy, for example, during the
   physical exercises, the analysis of the periodicity in the patient's
   performance would help to evaluate and monitor the his recovery process.
   Cyber Physical Systems for smart environments have great potential in
   providing context-aware, automated support in everyday life of people
   that need adaptive occupational therapy. We present a method and
   program-based algorithm for the detection and analysis of periodic
   activities of subjects performing physical exercises from video
   sequences. The algorithm detects the beginning of a series of exercises
   of a given type, measures the duration of each of them, detects the end
   of the sequence and measures the number of repetitions. Experimental
   results with publicly available video dataset will prove the
   applicability of the proposed method for detection of repetitive

Abstract = {{These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as
   power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures
   are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects
   anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is
   especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because
   the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can
   execute illegal operations within the normal network communication
   defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend
   to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work,
   we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that
   estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with
   the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The
   proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication
   to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state.
   We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and
   confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support
   vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection
   rules.}},

Abstract = {{In a typical manufacturing setup, field sensors are used to detect the
   presence of moving material on the production line. Sensory information
   is interfaced with a centralized control systems for continuous and long
   distance monitoring. However, the field sensors are prone to failures
   and may cause frequent down-times which in turn causes reduction in
   productivity. In this paper, a practical and comprehensive visual
   inspection system is proposed to automatically control the plant
   operations. The proposed approach improves productivity and solves
   several challenges including the speed of execution to support real-time
   operations, number and choice of image processing stages as well as
   associated techniques and algorithms.
   The presented solution inspects a production process deployed in metal
   industry and detects the moving rods on a conveyor platform. The shape
   of the moving rods is characterized using a combination of GrabCut
   segmentation, and clustering-based image thresholding methods. To detect
   and track the movement of rods, proximity contours are identified using
   low-level pixel information of only two images: one when the conveyor is
   fully occupied with the rods and the other when the conveyor is empty.
   Further, this visual sensory information is used to automatically
   generate control logic for tracking and monitoring a conveyor platform
   and can be smoothly integrated with industrial control system enabling
   real-time closed loop operations.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of Internet of Things technology and smart manufacturing,
   the issues of cyber security in industrial control systems (ICS) have
   become of great concern. Critical infrastructures, such as power plants
   and water treatment facilities, which heavily rely on ICS, have
   increasingly come under cyberattack in recent years. These cyberattacks
   pose severe threats to public safety as well as national security.
   Therefore, protecting ICS from cyberattack is an important research
   issue in the era of information technology and operation technology
   convergence. In this study, we propose an anomaly detection method based
   on semi-supervised techniques for industrial control systems, using the

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems operate
   critical infrastructures in our modern society despite their
   vulnerability to attacks and misuse. There are several anomaly detection
   systems based on the cycles of polling mechanisms used in SCADA systems,
   but the feasibility of anomaly detection systems based on non-polling
   traffic, so called spontaneous events, is not well-studied. This paper
   presents a novel approach to modeling the timing characteristics of
   spontaneous events in an IEC-60870-5-104 network and exploits the model
   for anomaly detection. The system is tested with a dataset from a real
   power utility with injected timing effects from two attack scenarios.
   One attack causes timing anomalies due to persistent malfunctioning in
   the field devices, and the other generates intermittent anomalies caused
   by malware on the field devices, which is considered as stealthy. The
   detection accuracy and timing performance are promising for all the
   experiments with persistent anomalies. With intermittent anomalies, we
   found that our approach is effective for anomalies in low-volume traffic
   or attacks lasting over 1 hour.}},

   Systems (ICS) using digital signal processing (DSP) technology. By
   processing signals from sensors using a comb of digital low-pass filters
   (LPF), additional informative features, that describe the control

Abstract = {{This paper presents ``On Communication Through-Silicon-Via Test{''}
   (OCTT), an ECC-based method to localize faults without halting the
   operation of TSV-based 3D-IC systems. OCTT consists of two major parts
   named Statistical Detector and Isolation and Check. While Statistical
   Detector could detect open and short defects in TSVs that work without
   interrupting data transactions, the Isolation and Check algorithm
   enhances the ability to localize fault position. The Monte-Carlo
   simulations of Statistical Detector show x2 increment in the number of
   detected faults when compared to conventional ECC-based techniques.
   While Isolation and Check helps localize the number of defects up to x4
   and x5 higher. In addition, the worst case execution time is below
   65,000 cycles with no performance degradation for testing which could be
   easily integrated into real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{A cyber-physical system consists of sensors, microcontroller, networks,
   and actuators that interact with each other, generate a substantial
   amount of data, and form extremely complex system operational profiles.
   These heterogeneous components are subject to errors, e.g. spikes,
   off-sets, or delays, that may result in system failures. As the
   complexity of modern systems increases, it becomes a challenge to apply
   traditional fault detection and isolation methods to such complex
   systems.
   Deep learning based methods have surpassed traditional methods in terms
   of performance as the data size and complexity increase. The signals of
   cyber-physical systems are mainly time-series data. In this paper, we
   propose a new on-line error detection and mitigation approach for common
   sensor, computing hardware, and network errors of cyber-physical systems
   using deep learning based methods. More specifically, we train a Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a single step prediction model for
   the detection and mitigation of errors, like spikes, or offsets. In
   order to detect the long-duration errors that show no sharp change (a
   sudden drop or rise) between two successive data samples when errors
   occurred, e.g. network delays, we train an LSTM encoder-decoder as a
   multi-step prediction model. We also introduce the on-line error
   mitigation approach. Automatic recovery is achieved by replacing the
   detected errors with the predicted values. Finally, we demonstrate
   on-line error detection and mitigation capabilities of the trained
   single step and multistep predictors using representative case studies.}},

Pages = {{177460-177473}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been affected
   by heterogeneous cyberattacks that have a huge impact on the physical
   world and the people's safety. Nowadays, the techniques achieving the
   best performance in the detection of cyber anomalies are based on
   Machine Learning and, more recently, Deep Learning. Due to the incipient
   stage of cybersecurity research in ICS, the availability of datasets
   enabling the evaluation of anomaly detection techniques is insufficient.
   In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate reliable anomaly
   detection datasets in ICS that consists of four steps: attacks
   selection, attacks deployment, traffic capture and features computation.
   The proposed methodology has been used to generate the Electra Dataset,
   whose main goal is the evaluation of cybersecurity techniques in an
   electric traction substation used in the railway industry. Using the
   Electra dataset, we train several Machine Learning and Deep Learning
   models to detect anomalies in ICS and the performed experiments show
   that the models have high precision and, therefore, demonstrate the
   suitability of our dataset for use in production systems.}},

Abstract = {{The security of cyber physical systems such as autonomous vehicle
   platoons plays a vital role in ensuring passenger safety. An adversary
   in control of a single vehicle can degrade platoon efficiency or even
   cause collisions. In this paper, we focus on detecting an attack meant
   to destabilize a platoon, thereby causing collisions, and identifying
   the source of the attack (i.e., the vehicle under control of the
   adversary) using Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCDNN) and
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The vehicles in the platoon are
   assumed to be equipped with sensors (LIDAR and RADAR) that measure the
   range and relative speed of their immediate neighbors. These sensor
   data, modelled with noise following a Gaussian distribution, are used to
   train a FCDNN and CNN for attack detection and identification. The
   effectiveness of these networks are tested for different scenarios based
   on local and global sensor information availability. The initial study
   show that for a ten vehicle platoon, CNN detects and identifies an
   attack with highest accuracy of 97.5\%, just by using the own local
   sensor information. We also show that the range measurements provide
   better accuracy in comparison to the velocity measurements. The platoon
   is modelled and simulated in MATLAB and neural networks are generated
   and tested using Tensorflow and Keras deep learning libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are widely
   deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs) such as
   energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and
   computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have
   become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices
   and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network
   attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network
   protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network
   intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both
   conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of
   relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or
   flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and
   identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we
   design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack
   instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network
   models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using
   realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed
   deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion
   detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and
   providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.}},

Abstract = {{The search engine Shodan crawls the Internet for, among other things,
   Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ICS are devices used to operate and
   automate industrial processes. Due to the increasing popularity of the
   Internet, these devices are getting more and more connected to the
   Internet. These devices will, if not hidden, be shown on Shodan. This
   study uses Shodan, together with data found by other researches to plot
   the trends of these ICS devices. The studied trends focus on the country
   percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The results show
   that all studied countries, except the United States, have decreased
   their percentage of world total ICS devices. We suspect that this does
   not represent the real story, as companies are getting better at hiding
   their devices from online crawlers. Our results also show that the usage
   of old ICS protocols is increasing. One of the explanations is that
   industrial devices, running old communication protocols, are
   increasingly getting connected to the Internet. In addition to the trend
   study, we evaluate Shodan by studying the time it takes for Shodan to
   index one of our devices on several networks. We also study ways of
   avoiding detection by Shodan and show that, by using a method called
   port knocking, it is relatively easy for a device to hide from Shodan,
   but remain accessible for legitimate users.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect industrial control system to minimize the risk of damage or loss
   of resources. In this paper, an one-class Support Vector Machine based
   extended boundary (EB-OSCVM) is used to detect anomalies in industrial
   multivariate time series data from a simulated Tennessee Eastman Process
   (TEP) with many cyber attacks. In detail, determine the change points of
   each process variable and capture the causality relationship between the
   variables based on the location and time delay of the change points.
   Then, by monitoring the leaf nodes in the causality graph, we can know
   whether the system is abnormal, it can effectively reduce the dimension
   of process data. The EB-OSCVM extend classification boundary of OCSVM in
   order to reduce the error of noise, if data is outside the boundary of
   EB-OCSVM, there is an anomaly. Finally, tracing the anomaly source
   according to causal direction. An experiment is used to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach, the results demonstrate that the
   approach presents a high-accuracy solution and traces the source of
   anomaly correctly.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are playing important roles in the critical
   infrastructure now. A prominent family of CPSs are networked control
   systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over
   computer networks like the Internet. Communication over insecure
   networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we
   design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on
   system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error
   statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system
   operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it
   significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating
   controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic
   controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on
   a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal
   amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that
   the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator
   is also successful in alleviating the attack effects.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the detection problems of
   controller-to-actuator replay attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs).
   The replay attacks on controller-to-actuator channels can influence the
   dynamic property and even stability. For the detection task, we employ a
   pseudo-random signal to code those communication channels, and
   code-decode abnormalities are generated when replay attacks occur. The
   abnormalities can be modeled as an additional Gaussian signal in system
   dynamic. Then, an anomaly detector is designed with a new type, which
   combines the pseudorandom signal covariance, to detect the abnormalities
   caused by replay attack and pseudo-random code. As a result, we obtain
   an optimization problem to solve the threshold value of detector and the
   covariance of code signal. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the above conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The networking of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a worldwide trend.
   With the growing accessibility of data vulnerability to attacks
   increases. Recent cyber attacks like Triton point out the necessity of
   new methods to secure CPS. Despite multiple dissimilarities between CPS
   and a general IT system, the mature field of IT security can inspire new
   methods for the protection of CPS such as cryptography. The encryption
   of signals transferring through the network is not new. The homomorphic
   encryption scheme allows execution of mathematical operations in the
   encrypted domain. This allows to encrypt not only signals in the network
   but also parameters and variables of a remote monitoring system. In this
   way, it is much more difficult for the adversary to gather information
   about the plant to execute a stealthy attack. In this paper, a somewhat
   homomorphic encryption scheme is applied to a CPS to ensure safe and
   secure communication by protecting all signals and variables in the
   network without loss of performance. A numerical example demonstrates
   the security level that can he achieved by applying this scheme.}},

   systems is increasing and thus the danger of possible attacks on such

   between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors,
   which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or
   devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible
   attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a

   opens new opportunities to improve detection of cyber-physical attacks

   In this work, we present a fully-distributed dynamic state estimation
   algorithm using PMU measurement data. The dynamic state estimation is
   jointly designed with an innovation-based attack detection scheme to
   limit communication overhead. An attractive feature of our work is that
   each control area utilizes a local model of reduced dimension. The
   design of our algorithm uses an approximation to the state covariance
   matrix, which allows for a trade-off between computation, communication,
   and accuracy. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness

   IoT-Embedded Cyber-Physical Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Abstract = {{The identification of vulnerabilities in a mission-critical system is
   one of the challenges faced by a cyber-physical system (CPS). The
   incorporation of embedded Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it
   tedious to identify vulnerability and difficult to control the
   service-interruptions and manage the operations losses. Rule-based
   mechanisms have been considered as a solution in the past. However,
   rule-based solutions operate on the goodwill of the generated rules and
   perform assumption-based detection. Such a solution often is far from
   the actual realization of the IoT runtime performance and can be fooled
   by zero-day attacks. Thus, this paper takes this issue as motivation and
   proposes better lightweight behavior rule specification-based
   misbehavior detection for the IoT-embedded cyber-physical systems
   (BRIoT). The key concept of our approach is to model a system with which
   misbehavior of an IoT device manifested as a result of attacks
   exploiting the vulnerability exposed may be detected through automatic
   model checking and formal verification, regardless of whether the attack
   is known or unknown. Automatic model checking and formal verification
   are achieved through a 2-layer Fuzzy-based hierarchical context-aware
   aspect-oriented Petri net (HCAPN) model, while effective misbehavior
   detection to avoid false alarms is achieved through a
   Barycentric-coordinated-based center of mass calculation method. The
   proposed approach is verified by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   embedded in a UAV system. The feasibility of the proposed model is
   demonstrated with high reliability, low operational cost, low
   false-positives, low false-negatives, and high true positives in
   comparison with existing rule-based solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Modern indusfrial control systems (ICS) are increasingly becoming
   targets of cyber attacks. Traditional security tools based on a

   can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and

   advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A
   reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning
   techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine
   learning (decision free algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector

   have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries.
   The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to
   deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is
   signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end,
   we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly
   detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model
   that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of
   communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups.
   First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale
   the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to
   improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited
   nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using
   the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system
   for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally,
   to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection
   with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly
   detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset
   generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed
   approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate
   of 97\%.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-modalities are ideal for user authentication in Medical
   Cyber-Physical Systems. Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the
   face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user
   authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been
   developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection
   systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some
   of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the
   bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained,
   heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors.
   Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor
   management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software
   client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable
   communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis.
   Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect
   bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS. In this regard, we propose a
   machine learning based security algorithm run as an application at the
   fog node using a binarized multi-factor boosted ensemble learner
   algorithm coupled with feature selection. Our proposal is verified on
   real datasets provided by the Replay Attack, Warsaw and LiveDet 2015
   Crossmatch benchmark for face, iris and fingerprint modality spoofing
   detection used for authentication in an MCPS. The experimental analysis
   shows that our approach achieves significant performance gain over the
   state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are growing with added complexity and
   functionality. Multidisciplinary interactions with physical systems are
   the major keys to CPS. However, sensors, actuators, controllers, and
   wireless communications are prone to attacks that compromise the system.
   Machine learning models have been utilized in controllers of automotive
   to learn, estimate, and provide the required intelligence in the control
   process. However, their estimation is also vulnerable to the attacks
   from physical or cyber domains. They have shown unreliable predictions
   against unknown biases resulted from the modeling. In this paper, we
   propose a novel control design using conditional generative adversarial
   networks that will enable a self-secured controller to capture the
   normal behavior of the control loop and the physical system, detect the
   anomaly, and recover from them. We experimented our novel control design
   on a self-secured BMS by driving a Nissan Leaf S on standard driving
   cycles while under various attacks. The performance of the design has
   been compared to the state-of-the-art; the self-secured BMS could detect
   the attacks with 83\% accuracy and the recovery estimation error of 21\%
   on average, which have improved by 28\% and 8\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging smart grid, cyber-physical infrastructure, provides a
   steady, secure, and reliable power system over the current power grid.
   Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key
   element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure
   time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast
   sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and
   data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120
   samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher
   data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a
   challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this
   paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning
   techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying
   system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this
   paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the
   RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic
   synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data
   concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the
   algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm has been tested in real-time
   using an OPAL-RT digital real-time simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-attacks against Critical
   Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose,
   designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a
   significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks.
   Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine
   learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks.
   Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge,
   ``Curse of dimensionality{''}. This scenario accentuates the necessity
   of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it
   identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features
   without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel
   filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of
   informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based
   Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were
   carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of
   RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall,

Abstract = {{Operational Technology (OT) often refers to the industrial control
   systems which are used to monitor and control the devices and processes
   of critical infrastructure like, water treatment plant, power grid and
   sewage systems. Conventionally, these OT systems are completely isolated
   from Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to protect their
   processes and devices against cyber-attacks. However, the convergence of
   IT and OT is inevitable to improvise the remote management of physical
   devices and to enhance the production by incorporating data-driven
   decision making by accessing and analyzing their real-time data. To
   achieve this, the isolated OT systems and devices need to be accessed
   using Internet. However, this interconnection leads both the sensor and
   control data of OT systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This research
   work extends our previous intrusion detection system that identifies
   anomalies which are deviated from process-invariants in secured water
   treatment (SWaT) test-bed data obtained from Singapore University of
   Technology and Design (SUTD). Additionally, it proposes
   process-invariants based timed automata wherein the attack and its
   detection model are represented as timed automata. The proposed system
   is implemented and validated using UPPAAL, a tool for validating
   real-time systems represented as networks of timed automata. The results
   conclude that the proposed system effectively identifies the attacks
   considered thereby recommending the timed automata as an operational
   tool for detecting the data-integrity attacks in critical
   infrastructures. The highly reported attacks that include level
   indicators, motorized valves, pressure indicators and analyzer
   indicators are detected successfully by the proposed system. Using the
   results, Stage 1 and Stage 3 are highly vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor localization has become popular in recent years due to the
   increasing need of location-based services in mobile cyber-physical
   systems (CPS). The massive deployment of light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   further promotes the indoor localization using visual light. As a key
   enabling technique for mobile CPS, accurate indoor localization based on
   visual light communication remains nontrivial due to various
   non-idealities such as attenuation induced by unexpected obstacles. The
   anomalies of localization can potentially reduce the dependability of
   location-based services. In this article, we develop a novel indoor
   localization framework based on relative received signal strength. Most
   importantly, an efficient method is derived from the triangle inequality
   to automatically detect the abnormal LED lamps that are blocked by
   obstacles. These LED lamps are then ignored by our localization
   algorithm so that they do not bias the localization results, which
   improves the dependability of our localization framework. As
   demonstrated by the simulation results, the proposed techniques can
   achieve superior accuracy over the conventional approaches, especially
   when there exist abnormal LED lamps.}},

Abstract = {{The violation of data integrity in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems
   (CPS) may lead to dangerous situations for drivers and pedestrians in
   terms of safety. In particular, cyber-attacks on the sensor could easily
   degrade data accuracy and consistency over any other attack, we
   investigate attack detection and identification based on a deep learning
   technology on wheel speed sensors of automotive CPS. For faster recovery
   of a physical system with detection of the cyber-attacks, estimation of
   a specific value is conducted to substitute false data. To the best of
   our knowledge, there has not been a case of joining sensor attack
   detection and vehicle speed estimation in existing literature. In this
   work, we design a novel method to combine attack detection and
   identification, vehicle speed estimation of wheel speed sensors to
   improve the safety of CPS even under the attacks. First, we define
   states of the sensors based on the cases of attacks that can occur in
   the sensors. Second, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is applied to detect
   and identify wheel speed sensor attacks. Third, in order to estimate the
   vehicle speeds accurately, we employ Weighted Average (WA), as one of
   the fusion algorithms, in order to assign a different weight to each
   sensor. Since environment uncertainty while driving has an impact on
   different characteristics of vehicles and causes performance
   degradation, the recovery mechanism needs the ability adaptive to
   changing environments. Therefore, we estimate the vehicle speeds after
   assigning a different weight to each sensor depending on driving
   situations classified by analyzing driving data. Experiments including
   training, validation, and test are carried out with actual measurements
   obtained while driving on the real road. In case of the fault detection
   and identification, classification accuracy is evaluated. Mean Squared
   Error (MSE) is calculated to verify that the speed is estimated
   accurately. The classification accuracy about test additive attack data
   is 99.4978\%. MSE of our proposed speed estimation algorithm is 1.7786.
   It is about 0.2 lower than MSEs of other algorithms. We demonstrate that
   our system maintains data integrity well and is safe relatively in
   comparison with systems which apply other algorithms.}},

Title = {{On-Device AI-Based Cognitive Detection of Bio-Modality Spoofing in
   Medical Cyber Physical System}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{2126-2137}},
Abstract = {{Bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, and fingerprint, are ideal for
   establishing authentication in the futuristic networks, such as the
   medical cyber physical systems (MCPSs). In such a network, to
   authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be
   traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they
   are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not
   only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the
   data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving
   on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification
   problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real
   bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device
   AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a
   light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the
   feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of
   random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation
   mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed
   approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the
   network as cloud computation and communication is removed. Our proposal
   is verified on real datasets of the face, iris, and fingerprint
   bio-modalities provided by the Warsaw, Replay-Attack, and LiveDet 2015
   Crossmatch benchmark, respectively. The experimental results show that
   our model can outperform the state-of-the-art architectures in four out
   of six tests. Besides, we show that the FA-RF can significantly reduce
   the training and testing time in both the cloud and the on-device AI
   node.}},

Abstract = {{Smart water infrastructures are prone to cyber-physical attacks that can
   disrupt their operations or damage their assets. An algorithm was
   developed to identify suspicious behaviors in the different
   cyber-physical components of a smart water distribution system. The
   algorithm incorporated multiple modules of anomaly-detection techniques
   to recognize different types of anomalies in the real-time monitoring
   and control data. Trained artificial neural networks were used to detect
   unusual patterns that do not conform to normal operational behavior.
   Principal component analysis was conducted to decompose the
   high-dimensional space occupied by the sensory data to uncover global
   anomalies. The algorithm was trained using a historical data set of
   trusted observations and tested against a validation and a test data
   set, both featuring a group of simulated attack scenarios. The proposed
   approach successfully identified all the attacks featured in the Battle
   of the Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL) data sets with high
   sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, the performance was sensitive
   to high background noise in the sensory data. (C) 2018 American Society

Abstract = {{Two novel luminescent cadmium coordination polymers (Cd-CPs),
   {[}Cd(TPA)(DIB)](n) (1) and {[}Cd(TPA)(BIYB)](n) (2), have been
   successfully designed and synthesized using Cd2+, deprotonated
   3,3'-thiodipropionic acid (H(2)TPA), and 4,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)
   biphenyl (BIYB) or 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl) benzene (DIB). CP 1 has a 3D
   structure with a new topology. CP 2 possesses a double layer 2D
   structure with two types of 1D tunnel. The fluorescence property
   application and mechanisms of the two Cd-CPs for detecting Hg2+,
   Cr2O72-, nitrobenzene (NB), or 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) have been
   researched. CPs 1-2 demonstrate good chemical stability, high
   sensitivity and selective responsive detection of Hg2+, Cr2O72-, NB, or
   2,4-DNP. The high quenching percentages in dilute aqueous solutions were
   98.5\% (Hg2+, 1), 96.2\% (Hg2+, 2), 98.5\% (Cr2O72-, 1), 96.4\%
   (Cr2O72-, 2), 99.6\% (NB, 1) and 99.2\% (2,4-DNP, 2). The detection
   limits were 2.1 x 10(-7) (Hg2+, 1), 1.1 x 10(-6) (Cr2O72-, 1), 2.7 x
   10(-7) (NB, 1), 1.9 x 10(-7) (Hg2+, 2), 2.4 x 10(-7) (Cr2O72-, 2), and
   1.3 x 10(-7) (2,4-DNP, 2) and are similar to the permissible limits set
   by the USEPA. The mechanism of Hg2+ luminescence quenching involves an
   interaction with the free thio sites of the CPs. The Cr2O72-, NB, and
   2,4-DNP quenching mechanism involves the overlap of the absorption bands
   of the recognition materials with the excitation or emission bands of
   CPs 1-2. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best examples of
   CPs as probes for sensing Hg2+, Cr2O72-, NB, or 2,4-DNP.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS
   networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption
   methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy
   equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities

   fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion
   detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the
   simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware
   configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing
   time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to
   achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The
   device finger-printing-based intrusion classification and detection
   approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a new engineering paradigm, which
   combine the cyber and physical world with comprehensive computational
   and analytical tools to solve complex tasks. In cyber-physical systems,
   components are developed to detect failures, prevent failures, or
   mitigate the failures of a system. Sensors gather real-time data as an
   input to the system for further processing. Therefore, the whole
   cyber-physical system depends on sensors to accomplish their tasks and
   the failure of one sensor may lead to the failure of the whole system.
   To address this issue, we present an approach that utilizes the Failure
   Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis, which is a prominent hazard
   analysis technique to increase the understanding of risk and failure
   prevention. In our approach, we transform the Failure Modes, Effects,
   and Criticality Analysis model into a UML(Unified Modeling Language)
   class diagram, and then a knowledge base is constructed based on the
   derived UML class diagram. Finally, the UML class diagram is used to
   build an ontology. The proposed approach employs a 5C architecture for
   smart industries for its systematic application. Lastly, we use a smart
   home case study to validate our approach.}},

Abstract = {{In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or
   aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient
   methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is
   introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the
   Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine
   invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds
   to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The
   limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a
   context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting
   dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier
   detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical
   guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of
   outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called
   matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice
   combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility
   to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant
   components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A
   simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and
   provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The
   performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets
   using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper. (C) 2018

Title = {{Adaptive Threshold Generation for Fault Detection with High
   Dependability for Cyber-Physical Systems}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPS) applied to safety-critical or
   mission-critical domains require high dependability including safety,
   security, and reliability. However, the safety of CPS can be
   significantly threatened by increased security vulnerabilities and the
   lack of flexibility in accepting various normal environments or
   conditions. To enhance safety and security in CPS, a common and
   cost-effective strategy is to employ the model-based detection
   technique; however, detecting faults in practice is challenging due to
   model and environment uncertainties. In this paper, we present a novel
   generation method of the adaptive threshold required for providing
   dependability for the model-based fault detection system. In particular,
   we focus on statistical and information theoretic analysis to consider
   the model and environment uncertainties, and non-linear programming to
   determine an adaptive threshold as an equilibrium point in terms of
   adaptability and sensitivity. To do this, we assess the normality of the
   data obtained from real sensors, define performance measures
   representing the system requirements, and formulate the optimal
   threshold problem. In addition, in order to efficiently exploit the
   adaptive thresholds, we design the storage so that it is added to the
   basic structure of the model-based detection system. By executing the
   performance evaluation with various fault scenarios by varying
   intensities, duration and types of faults injected, we prove that the
   proposed method is well designed to cope with uncertainties. In
   particular, against noise faults, the proposed method shows nearly 100\%
   accuracy, recall, and precision at each of the operation, regardless of
   the intensity and duration of faults. Under the constant faults, it
   achieves the accuracy from 85.4\% to 100\%, the recall of 100\% from the
   lowest 54.2\%, and the precision of 100\%. It also gives the accuracy of
   100\% from the lowest 83.2\%, the recall of 100\% from the lowest
   43.8\%, and the precision of 100\% against random faults. These results
   indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly better
   performance than existing dynamic threshold methods. Consequently, an
   extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method
   is able to accurately and reliably detect the faults and achieve high
   levels of adaptability and sensitivity, compared with other dynamic
   thresholds.}},

Title = {{Wind Turbine Multi-Fault Detection and Classification Based on SCADA
   Data}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to the increasing installation of wind turbines in remote locations,
   both onshore and offshore, advanced fault detection and classification
   strategies have become crucial to accomplish the required levels of
   reliability and availability. In this work, without using specific
   tailored devices for condition monitoring but only increasing the
   sampling frequency in the already available (in all commercial wind
   turbines) sensors of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system, a data-driven multi-fault detection and classification
   strategy is developed. An advanced wind turbine benchmark is used. The
   wind turbine we consider is subject to different types of faults on
   actuators and sensors. The main challenges of the wind turbine fault
   detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and
   significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA
   measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature
   transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a
   new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal
   component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold
   cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is
   applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first
   choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some
   particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the
   detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in
   this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the
   selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed
   that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall
   accuracy of 98.2\%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed
   allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition
   monitoring in wind turbines.}},

Title = {{A malicious threat detection model for cloud assisted internet of things

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively used in modern
   industries combined with the conventional industrial control system
   (ICS) network through the industrial cloud to make the production data
   easily available to the corporate business management and easier control
   for highly profitable production systems. The different devices within
   the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an
   isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of
   the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the
   manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration
   with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks
   are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by
   malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous
   update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts
   from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection
   of ICS.
   Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach
   performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach
   (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization
   of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training
   techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for
   real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat
   detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep
   learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern
   recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure.
   Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the
   domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of
   huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of
   deep learning to design our detection model.
   Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed
   in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data
   for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural
   network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained
   using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about
   the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed
   detection models is that the models are adaptive where training
   procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt
   new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at
   the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks
   and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks.
   Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and
   values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes,
   learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models
   find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other
   parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a
   real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed
   approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms
   and obtain similar performances with earlier semi supervised work (Huda
   et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model. (C)

Abstract = {{The recent increase in frequency and severity of cyber-physical attacks
   on water treatment plants and distribution systems calls for the
   development of intrusion detection schemes that help protect these
   critical infrastructures. This paper contributes an algorithm
   specifically designed for detecting and localizing cyber attacks against
   water distribution systems. The algorithm builds on the idea of learning
   a data-driven model that reproduces the patterns of all hydraulic
   processes observed within a distribution system: the model is trained
   using data pertaining to normal operating conditions, in order to poorly
   reproduce anomalous patterns, such as those induced by cyber attacks.
   The modeling process is carried out using autoencoders, a deep learning
   neural network architecture capable of building a compressed and
   meaningful representation of high-dimensional input data patterns. The
   algorithm is developed and tested on three data sets devised for the
   Battle of the Attack Detection Algorithmsthe only open-source data
   available, at this stage, for research in cyber security of water
   networks. Results show that the detection algorithm can identify all
   attacks featured in the data sets, including those compromising data
   integrity. The algorithm has two additional important features: it
   localizes the components under attack, and it is developed using only
   data pertaining to normal operating conditions, which are generally
   available to water utilities.}},

Abstract = {{Threats that cause malicious function such as information leakage and
   denial of service by adding hardware trojan (HT) to a device constructed
   using inexpensive elements at component level after shipment have been
   reported. The detection method after shipment, which is different from
   HT detection inside IC is required because of the easiness adding
   component-level HT to products. The testing method to detect
   modification on board will achieve the detection of component-level HT.
   In this brief, we focus on the HT implemented in the wiring connected to
   integrated circuits. Since the component connection constantly affects
   the impedance of the wiring, we propose a detection method for such HT
   implemented outside the IC by measuring the change in the impedance of
   the wiring. For the detection of malicious modification after shipment
   it is necessary to excite a pulse signal from the IC that achieves high
   security, such as a secure microcomputer, and observe the signal
   reflected inside the secure IC by the discontinuous portion of the
   impedance on the board. If the reflected signal is different from the
   shipping test, it can be judged that HT is mounted. We adopted time
   domain reflectometry (TDR) to realize the above method, and we
   demonstrate experimental result of component-level HT detection using
   TDR with measuring instrument and TDR from secure IC. As a result, a
   significant change in the amplitude due to the impedance change was
   obtained from the reflected wave measured inside the IC with and without
   the MOSFET used as the HT using this method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a general event-triggered framework is constructed to
   investigate the problem of remote fault detection for stochastic
   cyber-physical systems subject to the additive disturbances, sensor
   nonlinearities and deception attacks. Both fault-detection residual
   generation and evaluation module are fully described. Two energy norm
   indices are presented so that the fault-detection residual has the best
   sensitivity to faults and the best robustness to unwanted factors
   including additive disturbances and false information injected by
   attacker. Moreover, the filter gain and residual weighting matrix are
   formulated in terms of stochastic Lyapunov function, which can be
   conveniently solved via standard numerical software. Finally, an
   application example is presented to verify the performance of fault
   detection by comparative simulations. The prolonged battery life is
   experimentally evaluated and analyzed via a wireless node platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a binary detection problem over a nonsecure

   cyber attacks, which are modeled as jamming signals injected to the
   network, a likelihood ratio based (LRB) scheduler is designed in the
   sensor to smartly select informative sensor measurements for
   transmission. We show that even under a moderate transmission rate
   constraint of secure networks, an optimal LRB scheduler can achieve a
   comparable asymptotic detection performance to the standard
   Neyman-Pearson test using the full set of measurements, and is strictly
   better than the random scheduler. For nonsecure networks, the LRB
   scheduler can also maintain the detection functionality but suffers
   graceful performance degradation under different attack intensities.
   Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic industry has been experiencing a growing counterfeit
   market, resulting in electronic supply chains in other industries to be
   prone to counterfeit parts as well. Over the past few years, several
   methods have been developed for evaluating the reliability of an IC and
   distinguishing them as counterfeit or authentic. Trained experts offer
   services for evaluating an IC based on destructive or non-destructive
   methods. However, defect detection and recognition are mostly dependent
   on human decision, and therefore are vulnerable to error. In this paper,
   we propose a method to automatically detect and identify die-face
   delamination on an IC die. Die-face delamination is a predominant
   internal defect in recycled ICs but can be easily missed during defect
   detection. Here, we have acquired the 3D image of an IC
   non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography and applied image
   processing techniques and machine learning algorithms on the 3D image to
   detect die-face delamination in the forms of thermally induced cracks
   and damaged surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs) has become an increasingly
   vital concern for the security of commercial and mission-critical
   systems. Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety
   threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework
   consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and
   post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets
   several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked,
   out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor
   consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce
   reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic
   properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed
   by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists
   of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a
   recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring
   oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage
   estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a
   more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can
   allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to
   detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor,
   we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect
   and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be
   registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID,
   which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that
   the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared
   to traditional on-chip sensors.}},

Title = {{Anomaly detection for industrial control systems using process mining}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{103-125}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are moving from dedicated
   communications to switched and routed corporate networks, exposing them
   to the Internet and placing them at risk of cyber-attacks. Existing
   methods of detecting cyber-attacks, such as intrusion detection systems
   (IDSs), are commonly implemented in ICS and SCADA networks. However,
   these devices do not detect more complex threats that manifest
   themselves gradually over a period of time through a combination of
   unusual sequencing of activities, such as process-related attacks.
   During the normal operation of ICSs, ICS devices record device logs,
   capturing their industrial processes over time. These logs are a rich
   source of information that should be analysed in order to detect such
   process-related attacks.
   In this paper, we present a novel process mining anomaly detection
   method for identifying anomalous behaviour and cyber-attacks using ICS
   data logs and the conformance checking analysis technique from the
   process mining discipline. A conformance checking analysis uses logs
   captured from production systems with a process model (which captures
   the expected behaviours of a system) to determine the extent to which
   real behaviours (captured in the logs) matches the expected behaviours
   (captured in the process model). The contributions of this paper include
   an experimentally derived recommendation for logging practices on ICS
   devices, for the purpose of process mining-based analysis; a formalised
   approach for pre-processing and transforming device logs from ICS
   systems into event logs suitable for process mining analysis; guidance
   on how to create a process model for ICSs and how to apply the created
   process model through a conformance checking analysis to identify
   anomalous behaviours. Our anomaly detection method has been successfully
   applied in detecting ICS cyber-attacks, which the widely used IDS Snort
   does not detect, using logs derived from industry standard ICS devices.

Abstract = {{Background: In industrial disasters, early detection of problems and
   crisis management are critical for saving the lives of people and
   reducing the impact of disasters.
   Purpose: In this study, we design a special gateway system that bridges
   the gap between different communication protocols and enables legacy
   supervisory control and data acquisition systems to function early
   detection systems for potential industrial disasters.
   Methods: The system uses a new queue mechanism to substantially improve
   the problem of data loss found in conventional supervisory control and
   data acquisition systems and utilizes identification (ID) prioritization
   to enable early detection of problems. The proposed system is
   implemented and tested on a Linux-based, 3G-capable Modbus gateway
   system. Modbus is used as the communication protocol and 3G technology
   is utilized to provide high-speed wireless data transfer components. The
   Modbus gateway device uses an ARM-based EP9302 processor and has digital
   input/output, relay outputs, and RS485 outputs.
   Conclusion: This study is significant as it is the first work to show
   the application of the priority query execution method for Modbus
   gateway devices.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks to Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are detected by Industrial
   Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs). Operation of stage-based CPSs
   (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three
   parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and
   normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art
   IIDSs directly ad-dress cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states
   whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate
   cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to
   detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically
   extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS
   behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field
   layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to
   illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three
   cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process
   indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O
   CPSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies an attacker against a cyber-physical system (CPS)
   whose goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while
   ensuring that his or her probability of being detected does not exceed a
   given bound. The attacker's probability of being detected is related to
   the non-negative bias induced by his or her attack on the CPS's
   detection statistic. We formulate a linear quadratic cost function that
   captures the attacker's control goal and establish constraints on the
   induced bias that reflect the attacker's detection-avoidance objectives.
   When the attacker is constrained to be detected at the false alarm rate
   of the detector, we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a
   linear feedback of the attacker's state estimate. In the case that the
   attacker's bias is upper bounded by a positive constant, we provide two
   algorithms-an optimal algorithm and a suboptimal, less computationally
   intensive algorithm-to find suitable attack sequences. Finally, we
   illustrate our attack strategies in numerical examples based on a
   remotely controlled helicopter under attack.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily
   increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and
   maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind
   turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health
   monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric
   machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The
   standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability
   distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC
   approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve.
   Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model
   to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw
   misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss
   of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important
   to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful
   case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
   and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{The modern industrial control systems now exhibit an increasing
   connectivity to the corporate Internet technology networks so as to make
   full use of the rich resource on the Internet. The increasing
   interaction between industrial control systems and the outside Internet
   world, however, has made them an attractive target for a variety of
   cyber attacks, raising a great need to secure industrial control
   systems. Intrusion detection technology is one of the most important
   security precautions for industrial control systems. It can effectively
   detect potential attacks against industrial control systems. In this
   survey, we elaborate on the characteristics and the new security
   requirements of industrial control systems. After that, we present a new
   taxonomy of intrusion detection systems for industrial control systems
   based on different techniques: protocol analysis based, traffic mining
   based, and control process analysis based. In addition, we analyze the
   advantages and disadvantages of different categories of intrusion
   detection systems and discuss some future developments of intrusion
   detection systems for industrial control systems, in order to promote
   further research on intrusion detection technology for industrial

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries' industrial
   facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough
   security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not
   preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day
   against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical
   infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets.
   For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention
   of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis
   was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the
   most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was
   created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing
   this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the
   critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to
   prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the
   existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In
   the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were
   used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used
   for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach
   will provide significant contributions to attract attention to
   vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems.

Abstract = {{Detection errors such as false alarms and undetected faults are
   inevitable in any practical anomaly detection system. These errors can
   create potentially significant problems in the underlying application.
   In particular, false alarms can result in performing unnecessary
   recovery actions while missed detections can result in failing to
   perform recovery which can lead to severe consequences. In this paper,
   we present an approach for application-aware anomaly detection (AAAD).
   Our approach takes an existing anomaly detector and configures it to
   minimize the impact of detection errors. The configuration of the
   detectors is chosen so that application performance in the presence of
   detection errors is as close as possible to the performance that could
   have been obtained if there were no detection errors. We evaluate our
   result using a case study of real-time control of traffic signals, and
   show that the approach outperforms significantly several baseline
   detectors.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling
   (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for
   wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe
   process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for
   detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method
   is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem.
   In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an
   activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to
   decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner
   chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8\%,
   83.3\%, 67.9\%, and 25.4\% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V,
   respectively, for a typical die at 25 degrees C, compared to baseline
   frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is
   suitable for wide-operating-range applications.}},

Abstract = {{The use of control-theoretic solutions to detect attacks against
   cyber-physical industrial systems is a growing area of research.
   Traditional literature proposes the use of control strategies to retain,
   eg, satisfactory close-loop performance, as well as safety properties,
   when a communication network connects the distributed components of a
   physical system (eg, sensors, actuators, and controllers). However, the
   adaptation of these strategies to handle security incidents is an
   ongoing challenge. In this paper, we survey the advantages of a
   watermark-based detector against some integrity attacks as well as the
   weaknesses against other attacks. To cover these weaknesses, we propose
   a new control and security strategy that complements the watermark-based
   detector. We validate the detection efficiency of the new strategy via
   numeric simulation. Experimental results are also presented by using a
   laboratory testbed based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   industrial protocols.}},

   model invalidation approach}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{476-488}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for
   cyber-physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models
   with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach
   builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a
   set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input-output data is
   compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this
   set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved
   efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the
   second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the
   concept of T-detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault
   models satisfies T-detectability property for a finite T, this allows
   the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon
   manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the
   concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed
   approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture
   language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of
   the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart
   building radiant systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{Cyber Physical System(CPS) allows to collect different sensor and alarm
   data from large number of facilities in industrial plants. Failure and
   faulty diagnosis is one of the most complicated and dynamic problems in
   the industrial plant management since most of failures are extremely
   ambiguous which needs to be solved based on an expert's experience. This
   makes the solutions very subjective and requires too much time, efforts
   and monetary investment. In this paper, we are proposing new failure
   detection approach with machine learning and human expertise by using
   alarm data. As the first step of developing this new method, we
   collected several types of alarm data that detected functional failure
   in Hyundai Steel factory. We analyzed and processed the alarm data with
   35 domain experts. Based on the data, we propose a knowledge based
   system which is Ripple Down Rule-based. This system acquires knowledge
   by machine learning which is maintained by human experts. The evaluation
   results showed that the proposed failure detection framework can reduce
   the time of human expertise acquisition and the cost of solving
   over-generalization and over-fitting problems by using machine learning
   techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WIND ENERGY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Upwind horizontal axis wind turbines need to be aligned with the main
   wind direction to maximize energy yield. Attempts have been made to
   improve the yaw alignment with advanced measurement equipment but most
   of these techniques introduce additional costs and rely on alignment
   tolerances with the rotor axis or the true north.
   Turbines that are well aligned after commissioning may suffer an
   alignment degradation during their operational lifetime. Such changes
   need to be detected as soon as possible to minimize power losses. The
   objective of this paper is to propose a three-step methodology to
   improve turbine alignment and detect changes during operational lifetime
   with standard nacelle metrology (met) mast instruments (here: two cup
   anemometer and one wind vane).
   In step one, a reference turbine and an external undisturbed reference
   wind signal, e.g., met mast or lidar are used to determine flow
   corrections for the nacelle wind direction instruments to obtain a
   turbine alignment with optimal power production. Secondly a nacelle wind
   speed correction enables the application of the previous step without
   additional external measurement equipment. Step three is a monitoring
   application and allows the detection of alignment changes on the wind
   direction measurement device by means of a flow equilibrium between the
   two anemometers behind the rotor.
   The three steps are demonstrated at two 2 MW turbines together with a
   ground-based lidar. A first-order multilinear regression model gives
   sufficient correction of the flow distortion behind the rotor for our
   purposes and two wind vane alignment changes are detected with an
   accuracy of +/- 1.4 degrees within 3 days of operation after the change
   is introduced.
   We show that standard turbine equipment is able to align a turbine with
   sufficient accuracy and changes to its alignment can be detected in a
   reasonably short time, which helps to minimize power losses.}},

Abstract = {{As the main communication mediums in industrial control networks,
   industrial communication protocols are always vulnerable to extreme
   exploitations, and it is very difficult to take protective measures due
   to their serious privacy. Based on the SDN (Software Defined Network)
   technology, this paper proposes a novel event-based anomaly detection
   approach to identify misbehaviors using non-public industrial
   communication protocols, and this approach can be installed in SDN
   switches as a security software appliance in SDN-based control systems.
   Furthermore, aiming at the unknown protocol specification and message
   format, this approach first restructures the industrial communication
   sessions and merges the payloads from industrial communication packets.
   After that, the feature selection and event sequence extraction can be
   carried out by using the N-gram model and K-means algorithm. Based on
   the obtained event sequences, this approach finally trains an
   event-based HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to identify aberrant industrial
   communication behaviors. Experimental results clearly show that the
   proposed approach has obvious advantages of classification accuracy and
   detection efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Alarms affect operations in most part of the ship. Their impact on
   modern Engine Control Room operations is no less significant. The state
   of an alarm system serves as an indication of the extent to which the
   ship's operations are under management control. Thus, the design of
   efficient and reliable alarm monitoring system is vital for safe and
   sound operations. Although several design techniques have been proposed,
   all the proposed design methods employ sophisticated and expensive
   approaches in resolving alarm issues. In this paper, a cheap, yet
   reliable and efficient alarm design method for engine room device
   monitoring is presented. The design method employs PLCs and SCADA-based
   system and adopts certain basic design requirements of alarm monitoring
   system presented in literary works. Reasons for such a design method are
   highlighted, and the programming platforms for the design are given. The
   strengths and weaknesses of some design methods presented in some
   published works are reported and solutions to such problems are
   proposed. The proposed design technique, including fault diagnostic
   algorithm, have been subjected to real-time online testing at the
   shipyard, specifically Changjiang Waterway Bureau, China (ship name-Ning
   Dao 501). The testing results proved that this design technique is
   reliable, efficient and effective for online engine control room device
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Without robust security mechanisms, the smart grid remains vulnerable to
   many attacks that can cause serious damages. Since state estimation is a
   critical entity to monitor and control electricity production and
   distribution, intruders are more attracted by this entity in order to
   disrupt the smart grid reliability. In this context, we propose an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) architecture to detect lethal attacks
   with a focus on two smart grid security issues: (i) Firstly, against
   integrity issue with price manipulation attack, we propose a Cumulative
   Sum (CUSUM) algorithm that detects this attack even with granular price
   changes; (ii) Secondly, the availability issue with Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack against which we develop an efficient method to monitor and
   detect any misbehaving node. Performance evaluations show the robustness
   of the proposed IDS system compared to existing mechanisms. The achieved
   detection rate is above 95\% and the false positive rate is below 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the detection and compensation co-design
   issue for cyber-physical systems against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
   First, a novel supervisory strategy is proposed based on the concept of
   packet reception rate, which can detect the behavior of a DoS attacker
   during a given time window. A quantitative description of the
   relationship among attack times, time window, attack success rate and
   packet reception rate is analyzed. Based on the attack detection
   information, the current state under attack can be successfully
   reconstructed by some past available states. Then, a co-design
   compensation mechanism is also obtained, which can further guarantee the
   attacked system is stochastically stable (without the zero-mean Gaussian
   white noise) or mean square exponentially ultimately bounded (with the
   zero-mean Gaussian white noise). The corresponding design conditions are
   derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical
   example and a practical example are given to show the effectiveness and
   superiority of the presented design method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A developing trend of traditional industrial systems is the integration
   of the cyber and physical domain to improve flexibility and the
   efficiency of supervision, management, and control. But, the deep
   integration of these industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs),
   increases the potential for security threats. Attack detection, which
   forms initial protective barrier, plays an important role in overall
   security protection. However, most traditional methods focused on cyber
   information and ignored any limitations that might arise from the
   characteristics of the physical domain. In this paper, an anomaly
   detection approach based on zone partition is designed for ICPSs. In
   detail, initially an automated zone partition method, ensuring crucial
   system states can be observed in more than one zone, is designed. Then,
   methods of building zone function model, which do not require any prior
   knowledge of the physical system are presented before analyzing the
   anomaly based on zone information. Finally, an experimental rig is
   constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   results demonstrate that the approach presents a high-accuracy solution,
   which also performs effectively in real time.}},

Abstract = {{The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are the central research topic in the
   era of Industrial 4.0. Such systems interact intensively between
   physical entities and abstract information, and commonly exist in the
   industrial processes and people's daily lives. This paper investigates
   the practical difficulties of the vehicular CPSs online implementation,
   and based on that proposes a fault diagnosis and control architecture
   with modular units and reserved extendibility. It is elaborated that the
   systems' adaptability could be enhanced by either the online tracking
   techniques or the ensemble learning schemes. For the onboard deployment
   of automobile CPSs, the requirement of real-time capacity is in focus. A
   new recursive total principle component regression based design and

   detection. Simulation tests were carried out on the Carsim to compare

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of joint distributed attack

   cyber-physical system under physical and cyber attacks. The system is
   monitored by a wireless sensor network, in which a group of sensors is

   simultaneously launches a false data injection attack at the physical

   attacks at the cyber layer to block the wireless transmission channels
   between sensors and remote estimators. The sensors' measurements can be
   randomly dropped with mathematical probability if the corresponding
   transmission channels are deliberately jammed by the adversary.
   Resilient attack detection estimators are delicately constructed to
   provide locally reliable state estimations and detect the false data

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems have recently emerged in several practical
   engineering applications where security and privacy are of paramount
   importance. This motivated the paper and a recent surge of interest in
   development of innovative and novel anomaly and intrusion detection
   technologies. This paper proposes a novel distributed blind intrusion
   detection framework by modeling sensor measurements as the target
   graph-signal and utilizing the statistical properties of the
   graph-signal for intrusion detection. To fully take into account the
   underlying network structure, the graph similarity matrix is constructed
   using both the data measured by the sensors and sensors' proximity
   resulting in a data-adaptive and structure-aware monitoring solution. In
   the proposed supervised detection framework, the magnitude of the
   captured data is modeled by Gaussian Markov random field and the
   corresponding precision matrix is estimated by learning a graph
   Laplacian matrix from sensor measurements adaptively. The proposed
   intrusion detectionmethodology is designed based on a modified Bayesian
   likelihood ratio test and the closed-form expressions are derived for
   the test statistic. Finally, temporal analysis of the network behavior
   is established by computing the Bhattacharyya distance between
   themeasurement distributions at the consecutive time instants.
   Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method and to compare it with that of the state-of-the-art methods. The
   results show that the proposed intrusion detection framework provides a
   detection performance superior to those provided by the other existing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are today ubiquitous in urban
   environments. Such systems now serve as the backbone to numerous
   critical infrastructure applications, from smart grids to IoT

   sophisticated tools for monitoring the time series progression of the
   system, dynamically tracking relationships, and issuing alerts about
   anomalies to operators. We present an online monitoring system (illiad)
   that models the state of the CPS as a function of its relationships
   between constituent components, using a combination of model-based and
   data-driven strategies. In addition to accurate inference for state
   estimation and anomaly tracking, illiad also exploits the underlying
   network structure of the CPS (wired or wireless) for state estimation
   purposes. We demonstrate the application of illiad to two diverse

Abstract = {{The problem of attack detection in cyber-physical systems is considered
   in this paper. Transferentropy-based causality countermeasures are
   introduced for both sensor measurements and innovation sequences, which
   can be evaluated in a data-driven fashion without relying on a model of
   the underlying dynamic system. The relationships between the
   countermeasures and the system parameters as well as the noise
   statistics are investigated, based on which conditions that guarantee
   the time convergence of the countermeasures are obtained. The
   effectiveness of the transfer entropy countermeasures in attack
   detection is evaluated via theoretical analysis, numerical
   demonstrations, as well as comparative simulations with classical chi(2)
   detectors. Four types of attacks are considered: denial-of-service,
   replay, innovation-based deception, and data injection attacks. Abnormal
   behavior of the transfer entropy can be observed after the occurrence of
   each of these attacks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology based on cointegration analysis of

   monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Analysis of
   cointegration residuals obtained from cointegration process of wind
   turbine data is used for operational condition monitoring and automated
   fault and/or abnormal condition detection. The proposed method is
   validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine
   drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and
   operational conditions. A two-stage cointegration-based procedure is
   performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data
   trends have nonlinear characteristics. The method is tested using two
   case studies with known faults. The results demonstrate that the
   proposed method can effectively analyse nonlinear data trends,
   continuously monitor the wind turbine and reliably detect abnormal

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which are an integration of computation,
   networking, and physical processes, play an increasingly important role
   in critical infrastructure, government and everyday life. Due to
   physical constraints, embedded computers and networks may give rise to
   some additional security vulnerabilities, which results in losses of
   enormous economy benefits or disorder of social life. As a result, it is
   of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to
   ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper,
   from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent
   advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs.
   First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for
   the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of
   cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and
   deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective.
   Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are
   discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The
   development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed
   according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the
   security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally,
   some challenge issues are raised for the future research. (c) 2017

Abstract = {{Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring.
   Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious
   intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to
   the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA
   protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect
   attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in
   this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in
   SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system
   and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution
   of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for
   missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2)
   The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)
   are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score for
   intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and
   categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect
   intrusions effectively, with an F-1 score of respectively > 99\%.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans.
   Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for
   hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult
   to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based
   golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the
   algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without
   considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the
   simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from
   actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective
   classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan
   detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate
   simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing
   fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips.
   First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs.
   During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in
   the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the
   further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a
   statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm
   in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the
   increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique
   for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to
   obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training
   method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark
   circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans
   with high accuracy (92\%similar to 97\%) and recall (88\%similar to
   95\%).}},

Abstract = {{Due its complexity and a multitude of proprietary components, industrial
   control systems are an immanently difficult field of application for
   intrusion detection. Proprietary binary protocols and the lack of public
   specifications have forced the research community to move away from
   content-based detection to more abstract concepts. In this paper, we
   show that in contrast to prior belief the content of unknown binary
   protocols can very well be modeled. ZOE derives prototype models that
   are specific to individual types of messages in order to capture the
   characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enable detecting
   different forms of attacks as anomalies. In an evaluation based on 6
   days of network traffic recorded at a large power plant (1,900 MW) with
   over 92,000 unique devices, we demonstrate that ZOE improves upon
   related approaches by up to an order of magnitude in detection
   performance, but also significantly decreases false positives.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women today.
   Hence early detection of breast cancer is a challenging task. The paper
   involves the proposed method for breast cancer detection using imaging
   techniques such as mammography and thermography. The computer aided
   diagnosis tool is used as an efficient method to segment and classify
   the digital images. The data accessing for clinicians is difficult to
   due limited medical care in rural areas. Cyber-physical system (CPS)
   relates the virtual and physical world. CPS aids in integrating network,
   interacting between human and system, provides high flexibility,
   scalability and optimization. In medical field, CPS is used to attain a
   high quality healthcare. It has become a full-fledged system in breast
   cancer detection and performs all the process from patient's data
   acquisition till the decision making. It offers high safety for the
   patients by reducing errors and continuous monitoring of the data.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of modern information technologies with industrial
   control systems has created an enormous interest in the security of
   industrial control, however, given the cost, variety, and industry
   practices, it is hard for researchers to test and deploy security
   solutions in real-world systems. Industrial control testbeds can be used
   as tools to test security solutions before they are deployed, and in
   this paper we extend our previous work to develop open-source virtual
   industrial control testbeds where computing and networking components
   are emulated and virtualized, and the physical system is simulated
   through differential equations. In particular, we implement a nonlinear
   control system emulating a three-water tank with the associated sensors,
   PLCs, and actuators that communicate through an emulated network. In
   addition, we design unknown input observers (UIO) to not only detect
   that an attack is occurring, but also to identify the source of the
   malicious false data injections and mitigate its impact. Our system is
   available through Github to the academic community.}},

Abstract = {{As closed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) gradually evolve toward
   networking, ICS data and operational processes can be easily tampered
   with by attackers, causing industrial control equipment to fail or
   become damaged. Depending on the characteristics of ICS business logic
   stability, this paper proposes a novel two-level anomaly detection
   framework to ensure that system data and business logic are safe and
   reliable. Specifically, basic information is obtained from network
   traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification.
   In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer
   algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the
   input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer
   model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the
   normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown
   attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline
   network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection
   framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance
   than several current latest technologies.}},

   an approach is proposed for the secure state estimation in

   a switch in the system behaviour. We consider only two system modes,
   nominal mode and attacked mode. As the switching sequence is unknown,
   information coming from IT cybersecurity layer is used to guide the
   switching signal of the observer mode. The residual signal provided by
   the switched observer also influences the switching signal of the

   proven. An example is given to illustrate the advantage of the proposed

Abstract = {{The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is closely related to
   national security. With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS,
   highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system
   (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection
   threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection
   indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion
   detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in
   industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy
   consumption varies according to different operation types and system
   states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation,
   system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put
   forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on
   multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about
   power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system
   state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the
   multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm.
   Experimental results verify that our approach has a better detection
   performance than other detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{Today's globalized electronics supply chain is prone to counterfeit chip
   proliferation. Existing techniques to detect counterfeit integrated
   circuits (ICs) are limited by relatively high cost, lengthy inspection
   time, destructive nature, and restriction to a pre-packaging
   environment. We propose a novel method of counterfeit IC detection which
   takes advantage of design-specific electromagnetic (EM) fingerprints
   generated by simulating on-chip clock distribution networks. Through
   exploitation of the chip's physical characteristics, our technique can
   help detect foundry of origin. We validate our approach on 8051
   micro-controllers from three different vendors and utilize principal
   component analysis to distinguish the acquisitions by vendor. Our
   results show that near-field EM measurements combined with unsupervised
   machine learning provide approximate to 99\% accuracy in counterfeit
   detection through design-specific fingerprint classification.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical
   role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems.
   There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events
   or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to
   catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a
   preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to
   its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be
   generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most
   existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one
   or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about
   attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel
   edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks
   named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data
   and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct
   characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized
   before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is
   built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it.}},

Abstract = {{The increased complexity and interconnectivity of SCADA infrastructure
   in the power system have exposed it to the multitude of vulnerabilities.
   There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion
   detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control
   system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the
   application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in
   detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have
   applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later,
   compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in
   the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA
   security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the
   malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network
   traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based
   protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate
   the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack
   which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack
   on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the
   attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental
   results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks
   within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.}},

Abstract = {{While the ever-increasing connectivity of cyber-physical systems
   enlarges their attack surface, existing anomaly detection frameworks
   often do not incorporate the rising heterogeneity of involved systems.
   Existing frameworks focus on a single fieldbus protocol or require more
   detailed knowledge of the cyber-physical system itself. Thus, we
   introduce a uniform method and framework for applying anomaly detection
   to a variety of fieldbus protocols. We use stacked denoising
   autoencoders to derive a feature learning and packet classification
   method in one step. As the approach is based on the raw byte stream of
   the network traffic, neither specific protocols nor detailed knowledge
   of the application is needed. Additionally, we pay attention on creating
   an efficient framework which can also handle the increased amount of
   communication in cyber-physical systems.

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of networks and computers, industrial control
   systems (ICS) have become more interconnected. Many ICS are allowed
   remote interactions through the Internet. This increases the security
   risks of being attacked. If critical infrastructure ICS are attacked,
   the consequences could be catastrophic. To protect the ICS, the
   anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (ABNIDS) are used to
   detect novel cyber-attacks by learning both normal and abnormal network
   behaviours. The quality of the attack dataset directly influences the
   accuracy of the ABNIDS. Therefore, it is important to assess the quality
   of the attack datasets used to design and develop ABNIDS. To fulfil this
   goal, this paper provides assessment criteria for evaluating ICS attack
   datasets. These new assessment criteria demonstrate the various
   requirements of the dataset and analyse the effectiveness of the dataset
   in depth. Three existing ICS attack datasets for the DNP3, S7comm and
   Modbus protocols are assessed using these criteria. We find that there
   is a range of dataset creation techniques and levels of quality with no
   dataset that meets the ideal criteria. Since no existing work discusses
   assessment criteria for ICS attack datasets, this paper would be helpful
   to evaluate and improve the ICS attack datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection for industrial control systems (ICS) can leverage
   process data to detect malicious derivations from expected process
   behavior. We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state
   dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an
   attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system
   provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowledge of the
   network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of
   residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel
   state-aware anomaly detection technique. We implement and evaluate our
   anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the
   process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train
   the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the
   ICS. The results show that the proposed method improves prior works by
   providing less time-to-detect of attacks while generating fewer false

Abstract = {{For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced
   failures in dual damascene copper interconnects in today's and future
   sub-10nm ICs, one critical issue is how to create stressing conditions
   so that the chip will fail exclusively under EM in a very short period
   of time so that EM signoff and validation can be carried out
   efficiently. In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration
   techniques for practical VLSI chips. We will first review the recently
   proposed three-phase physics-based EM models and discuss the important
   factors contributing to the EM aging process. Then we propose a new
   formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general
   multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality
   check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure
   process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based
   acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with
   reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to
   significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable
   reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM
   accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we
   show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing
   temperature. On average, 10\% increase in temperature yields about 10X
   wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is
   not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations
   which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM,
   and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it
   is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying
   within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration
   techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and
   reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10
   years down to a few hours (about 10(5) acceleration) under the 150
   degrees C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM
   testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines are, generally, placed at remote locations and are subject
   to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes.
   Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair
   and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management
   using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the
   reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them
   more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for
   maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind
   turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a
   condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a
   wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation
   and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of
   age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical
   model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval
   Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance
   optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate
   models. The application of the maintenance management framework is
   demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems control
   several critical infrastructures, they have connected to the internet.
   Consequently, SCADA systems face different sophisticated types of cyber
   adversaries. This paper suggests a Probability Risk Identification based
   Intrusion Detection System (PRI-IDS) technique based on analysing
   network traffic of Modbus TCP/IP for identifying replay attacks. It is
   acknowledged that Modbus TCP is usually vulnerable due to its
   unauthenticated and unencrypted nature. Our technique is evaluated using
   a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a custom
   SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is
   exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an
   attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave. The
   experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique can
   effectively and efficiently recognise replay attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Sophisticated process-aware attacks targeting industrial control systems
   require adequate detection measures taking into account the physical
   process. This paper proposes an approach relying on automatically mined
   process specifications to detect attacks on sequential control systems.
   The specifications are synthesized as monitors that read the execution
   traces and report violations to the operator. In contrast to other
   approaches, a central aspect of our method consists in reducing the
   number of mined specifications suffering from redundancies. We evaluate
   our approach on a hardware-in-the-loop testbed with a complex physical
   process model and discuss our approach's mining efficiency and attack
   detection capabilities. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of

Title = {{A BP Neural Network-Based Communication Blind Signal Detection Method
   With Cyber-Physical-Social Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{43920-43935}},
Abstract = {{The development of wireless communication technologies will lead to an
   increase of rapid-time-variants featured occasions and physical
   occasions of small-data-size communication in network, and the
   modulation system diversification resulting from social group
   densification. Though traditional blind signal detection approaches have
   been improved by reducing their excessive reliance on data size, they
   still have the defects of various postulated conditions in new settings,
   complicated computation, unstable detection effect and high error rate.
   This paper aims to explore a communication blind signal detection method
   in the setting of cyber-physical-social systems in the field of
   back-propagation (BP) neural network. First, a BP neural network is used
   as the equalizer, an error function is redefined, and the
   back-propagation algorithm is used to train and adjust blind signal data
   deviation and to update network weight rules for adaptation to network
   settings with rapid time-variants. Second, a double-sigmoid BP neural
   network excitation function is constructed to improve poor multiple
   information processing and network performances resulting from social
   group densification. Third, self-adaptive variable step size for
   physical devices power is constructed to adjust the conflict between
   convergence rate and steady-state error caused by different powers with
   the increase of small-data-size communication. Finally, an output vector
   is made to be closest to an expected vector; thereby, blind signal
   detection rate of social groups communication using physical devices in
   the cyber environment can be improved. The experiments show that the
   communication blind signal detection method proposed in the paper
   improves signal detection precision, and reduces omission rate (below
   2\%). Besides, the method is characterized by minor error, removes
   deficiencies of traditional methods for blind signal extraction, and can
   effectively accomplish blind signal detection.}},

Abstract = {{Belt conveyor system is a crucial element of ore transport process in
   underground copper ore mine. Damage of single belt conveyor might cause
   stopping of huge part of underground transport network, especially when
   failure concerns the main haulage conveyor line. For that reason it is
   important to use SCADA monitoring system. The symptom of damage can be
   found in increasing temperature measured within the system.
   Unfortunately, operating belt conveyors can be considered as
   time-varying system and direct decision making using temperature value
   is difficult. Long-term analysis of time series enables to learn how to
   recognize alarming moment. Thus the removal of failure can be scheduled
   so as to minimize the losses in production. In this paper the clustering
   method was applied to the long-term observations of the temperature in
   order to gearbox fault detection. Moreover, the breaks in the activity
   of belt conveyors (no operation) caused by holidays will be determined.
   The clustering algorithm identifies also the specific character of the
   work at the beginning and end of week.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{37444-37453}},
Abstract = {{Stroke is one of the fatal diseases that affect the brain and causes
   death within 3 to 10 h. However, most of the deaths caused by a stroke
   can be avoided with the identification of the nature of stroke and react
   to it in a timely manner by intelligent health systems. The
   state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) enable interaction between
   physical and computational world to identify any anomaly in the physical
   world and respond to it. The response of CPS may vary depending upon the
   context of the physical world. Extensive research has been done in this
   area from the perspective of wireless sensor networks, body area
   networks, and wearable smart devices. This paper proposes a CPS for
   detecting the occurrence of stroke in patients, who have a high risk of
   stroke or have survived a stroke before. The developed CPS sends
   recorded data to the doctor and alerts him when the stroke occurs. The
   proposed system is operating on data acquired from
   electroencephalography sensors from patients' brain. This article aimed
   at decreasing human mortality rate due to stroke and will bridge the
   gaps in CPS due to interdisciplinary isolation. The disciplines involved
   in the development of a CPS include communication networks, pattern
   recognition, software engineering, mathematics, and biomedical.}},

   top challenges in medicine. Poor clinical outcomes are primarily caused
   by delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnostic
   criteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and already
   overloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuring
   devices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physical
   characterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains to
   provide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physical
   system (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnoses
   of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medical
   knowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model to
   characterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiency
   between physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-based
   medical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integrate
   medical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from the
   heavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decision
   support. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases.
   Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstrate
   that we enable early detection in 11.02\% more patients and detect the
   condition 16.57 hours earlier on average.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a major concern in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).
   In this paper, an algorithm based on Petri Net (PN) is proposed that
   simultaneously detects misuse and anomaly behavior of the system. The
   proposed anomaly detection method is applicable to Supervisory Control
   and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the highest level of CPSs. Neural
   First Order Hybrid Petri Net model (NFOHPN) with online fast Independent
   Component Analysis (ICA) is proposed for anomaly detection. It is shown
   that the use of distributed and multidisciplinary intrusion detection
   methods in different layers of CPSs increases security of the net
   against coordinated cyber-attacks. Simulation results and comparative
   studies based on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
   evaluation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can detect
   normal or malicious behavior with satisfying accuracy and at
   surprisingly high convergence speed.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous growth of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) poses a
   serious threat to our critical infrastructures due to their inferior
   quality and has become one of the major concerns to the government and
   the industry. Detection of these ICs is challenging especially when they
   have been used for a short period of time, as the process variations
   (especially in lower technology nodes) could outpace the degradation
   caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a robust, accurate, and
   low-cost solution for efficient detection of recycled ICs, even if they
   have been used for a very short period of time. The proposed solution
   utilizes a ring oscillator (RO), and a nonvolatile memory. It stores the
   RO frequency, conditions (e.g., supply voltage, temperature, and
   duration) for the frequency measurement, and a digital signature. The
   simulation and silicon results demonstrate that we can effectively
   detect recycled ICs used as low as one day.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems are the fundamental infrastructures of a
   country. Since the intrusion attack methods for industrial control
   systems have become complex and concealed, the traditional protection
   methods, such as vulnerability database, virus database and rule
   matching cannot cope with the attacks hidden inside the terminals of
   industrial control systems. In this work, we propose a control flow
   anomaly detection algorithm based on the control flow of the business
   programs. First, a basic group partition method based on key paths is
   proposed to reduce the performance burden caused by tabbed-assert
   control flow analysis method through expanding basic research units.
   Second, the algorithm phases of standard path set acquisition and path
   matching are introduced. By judging whether the current control flow
   path is deviating from the standard set or not, the abnormal operating
   conditions of industrial control can be detected. Finally, the
   effectiveness of a control flow anomaly detection (checking) algorithm
   based on Path Matching (CFCPM) is demonstrated by anomaly detection
   ability analysis and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, secure, remote estimation of a linear time-varying
   Gaussian process via observations at multiple sensors is considered.
   Such a framework is relevant to many cyberphysical systems and
   internet-of-things applications. Sensors make sequential measurements
   that are shared with a fusion center; the fusion center applies a form
   of optimal filtering to make its estimates. The challenge is the
   presence of malicious sensors which can inject anomalous observations to
   skew the estimates at the fusion center. The set of malicious sensors
   may be time-varying. The problems of malicious sensor detection and
   secure estimation are considered. First, a novel detector to detect
   injection attack on an unknown sensor subset is developed. Next, an
   algorithm for secure estimation is proposed. The proposed estimation
   scheme uses a novel filtering and learning algorithm, where an optimal
   filter is learnt over time by using the sensor observations in order to
   filter out malicious sensor observations while retaining other sensor
   measurements. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing industrial control systems (ICSs), such as building energy
   management systems (EMSs), were installed when potential security
   threats were only physical. With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now,
   typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be
   accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the
   potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact
   ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage,
   safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a
   novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which
   incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a
   reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an
   attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already
   implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the
   controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the
   proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real
   EMS site and simulated attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Intentional attacks(1) that cause country wide blackouts, gas and water
   systems malfunction are actions that can be carried out by a nation to
   impact on another nation in a mean of war. Supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) networks that allow for communication for the
   utilities companies were designed with no security in mind causing the
   systems that a nation relies on to fall vulnerable to exploitation.
   Since SCADA networks are static in nature with pre-defined signatures of
   network traffic, we propose to design an anomaly-based intrusion

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of incorporating context in medical
   cyber-physical systems (MCPS) applications for the purpose of improving
   the performance of MCPS detectors. In particular, in many applications
   additional data could be used to conclude that actual measurements might
   be noisy or wrong (e.g., machine settings might indicate that the
   machine is improperly attached to the patient); we call such data
   context. The first contribution of this work is the formal definition of
   context, namely additional information whose presence is associated with
   a change in the measurement model (e.g., higher variance). Given this
   formulation, we developed the contextaware parameter-invariant (CA-PAIN)
   detector; the CA-PAIN detector improves upon the original PAIN detector
   by recognizing events with noisy measurements and not raising
   unnecessary false alarms. We evaluate the CA-PAIN detector both in
   simulation and on real-patient data; in both cases, the CA-PAIN detector
   achieves roughly a 20-percent reduction of false alarm rates over the
   PAIN detector, thus indicating that formalizing context and using it in
   a rigorous way is a promising direction for future work.}},

Abstract = {{An attack detection scheme is proposed to detect data integrity attacks
   on sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). A combined fingerprint for
   sensor and process noise is created during the normal operation of the
   system. Under sensor spoofing attack, noise pattern deviates from the
   fingerprinted pattern enabling the proposed scheme to detect attacks. To
   extract the noise (difference between expected and observed value) a
   representative model of the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used
   for the purpose of state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates
   from the real system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown
   that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and
   sensor noise. A set of time domain and frequency domain features is
   extracted from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine
   learning algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are
   performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility
   and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm attacks,
   designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by the proposed
   scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely
   identified with accuracy higher than 90\% based on the noise
   fingerprint.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as water and power are critical to
   any society. Process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect such systems to minimize the risk of damage or loss of
   resources. In this paper, a graphical model-based approach is proposed
   for profiling normal operational behavior of an operational ICS referred
   to as SWaT (Secure Water Treatment). Timed automata are learned as a
   model of regular behaviors shown in sensors signal like fluctuations of
   water level in tanks. Bayesian networks are learned to discover
   dependencies between sensors and actuators. The models are used as a
   one-class classifier for process anomaly detection, recognizing
   irregular behavioral patterns and dependencies. The detection results
   can be interpreted and the abnormal sensors or actuators localized due
   to the interpretability of the graphical models. This approach is
   applied to a dataset collected from SWaT. Experimental results
   demonstrate the model's superior performance on both precision and
   run-time over methods including support vector machine and deep neural
   networks. The underlying idea is generic and applicable to other
   industrial control systems such as power and transportation.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure the proper functioning of critical systems, it is important to
   design secure Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Since CPS are connected
   systems, most studies consider external adversaries as a threat model,
   which might not be able to cater for an insider threat with the physical
   access to the system. In this article, we proposed an attack detection
   mechanism for an insider who has physical access to a CPS. The proposed
   method exploits the dynamics of the system and detects an attack based
   on the laws of Physics. Based on the mass flow equations, we analyze the
   rate of change in the plant's process and create a feature vector based
   on the process dynamics. The model has been trained by passing rate of
   change in system's state as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM), to
   detect the abnormal behavior in the system. Based on the proposed
   framework, experiments are performed on a real water treatment testbed,
   to validate our model and to measure the efficiency of the plant in
   normal and under attack scenarios. The detection result shows that
   proposed scheme can detect attacks with accuracy as high as 96\%.}},

   purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the
   existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false
   positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date
   and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to
   overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo
   Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based
   Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main
   intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a
   SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network
   dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the
   clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the
   best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the
   intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA
   algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the
   proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall,
   accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A wideband microwave method is described as a means for rapid detection
   of slight dissimilarities and aging effects in integrated circuits
   (ICs). The method is based on measuring the complex reflection
   coefficient of an IC when illuminated with an open-ended rectangular
   waveguide probe, at K-band (18-26.5 GHz) and Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz)
   microwave frequencies. The spatially integrated reflected
   electromagnetic signature of a given IC is a function of its internal
   material properties, geometry and metallic deposition of circuit
   element, and wire bonds. Consequently, dissimilar (including
   counterfeit) and aged ICs exhibit markedly different reflection
   properties than their reference and new (nonaged) counterparts. In
   addition to measuring spatially integrated complex reflection
   coefficient (over the waveguide aperture), it is also integrated over
   the operating frequency band (spectrally integrated), resulting in
   significant increase in the robustness of the approach.
   Root-mean-squared-error, defined as the average Euclidean distance
   between two reflection coefficient vectors, is used to associate a
   quantitative metric to the complex reflection coefficient difference
   between two dissimilar ICs. Measurement results on several sets of ICs
   having the same package (DIP-14) and different functionalities, similar
   functionalities with slight differences in specifications, and aged ICs
   are presented. The results clearly indicate the capability of this
   method to differentiate among ICs having slight differences in packaging
   material properties and/or electronic circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasingly widespread application of information and
   communication technology, the smart grid has gradually evolved into a
   cyber physical system characterised by deep integration between the
   information space and physical space. All manner of intrusion attacks on
   cyber physical power systems are growing more and more frequent. Timely
   and accurate detection and identification of these intrusions are
   essential for the effective control and protection of cyber physical
   power systems. For massive and high-dimensional intrusion behaviour data
   in cyber physical power systems, distributed intrusion detection based
   on hybrid gene expression programming and cloud (DID-HGEPCloud)
   computing is proposed. In the DID-HGEPCloud, attribution reduction with
   noise data based on rough set and a global intrusion model based on
   non-linear least squares are applied to improve the efficiency and
   accuracy of intrusion detection. At the same time, the MapReduce
   programming framework of cloud computing is adopted, and parallelisation
   of the model of the proposed algorithm is performed to enhance its
   ability to manage massive and high-dimensional data. Comparative
   experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious
   advantages in terms of false attack rate, DAR, and average time

Abstract = {{Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
   Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to
   be highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to
   asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of
   multiplexed ICS streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for
   anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA and a high
   false-alarm rate. In this article, we introduce a new modeling approach
   that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple
   DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that
   de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to
   their respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the
   statechart from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning
   algorithms first build a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the
   stream. Next, we split the symbols into sets, one per multiplexed cycle,
   based on symbol frequencies and node degrees in the DTMC graph. Then, we
   create a sub-graph for each cycle and extract Euler cycles for each
   sub-graph. The final statechart is comprised of one DFA per Euler cycle.
   The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, which appear in more than
   one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once in a cycle.
   We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the
   Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a
   collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed
   ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap.
   The algorithms were able to split the symbols into sets with 99.6\%
   accuracy. The resulting statechart modeled the traces with a median
   false-alarm rate of as low as 0.483\%. In all but the most extreme
   scenarios, the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm
   rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA
   model.}},

Abstract = {{False data injection (FDI) attacks are crucial security threats to smart
   grid cyber-physical system (CPS), and could result in cataclysmic
   consequences to the entire power system. However, due to the high
   dependence on open information networking, countering FDI attacks is
   challenging in smart grid CPS. Most existing solutions are based on
   state estimation (SE) at the highly centralized control center; thus,
   computationally expensive. In addition, these solutions generally do not
   provide a high level of security assurance, as evidenced by recent work
   that smart FDI attackers with knowledge of system configurations can
   easily circumvent conventional SE-based false data detection mechanisms.
   In this paper, in order to address these challenges, a novel distributed
   host-based collaborative detection method is proposed. Specifically, in
   our approach, we use a conjunctive rule based majority voting algorithm
   to collaboratively detect false measurement data inserted by compromised
   phas or measurement units (PMUs). In addition, an innovative reputation
   system with an adaptive reputation updating algorithm is also designed
   to evaluate the overall running status of PMUs, by which FDI attacks can
   be distinctly observed. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted
   with real-time measurement data obtained from the Power World simulator,
   and the numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC's) 0.35-mu m technology, we
   demonstrate the operation of two hardware Trojans, which leak the secret
   key of a wireless cryptographic integrated circuit (IC) consisting of an
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core and an ultrawideband (UWB)
   transmitter (TX). With their impact carefully hidden in the transmission
   specification margins allowed for process variations, these hardware
   Trojans cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the
   digital or the analog part of the IC and do not violate the transmission
   protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed
   adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power
   waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked
   with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB TX. Moreover,
   through physical measurements and MATLAB simulations, we show that the
   attack facilitated by these hardware Trojans is robust to test equipment
   and communication channel noise. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the

Abstract = {{In cyber-physical system (CPS) over IEEE 802.11e-based wireless local
   area networks (WLANs), a misbehaving node can gain significant advantage
   over other normal nodes in terms of resource sharing by deliberately
   manipulating its protocol parameters. Due to the random spectrum-access
   nature of the protocol, it is challenging to detect the misbehaving node
   accurately and in real-time. Moreover, many existing misbehavior
   detectors, primarily designed for traditional IEEE 802.11 networks,
   become inapplicable in IEEE 802.11e networks with heterogeneous network
   configurations. In this paper, we propose novel real-time and
   light-weight countermeasures including a hybrid-share misbehavior
   detector and a packet-dropping-based misbehavior mitigation mechanism
   for IEEE 802.11e-based CPS. We develop mathematical models for the
   performance of the proposed detector and mitigation mechanisms.
   Extensive simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms can
   achieve a high detection rate and punish a misbehaving node with a high
   packet dropping rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an ontology-based language, OntoEvent, for
   semantic complex event modeling and detection in Cyber-Physical Systems

   general concepts and domain-specific instances, to promise it can be
   dynamic extended for different CPS application domains. Complex events
   are modeled based on event ontology with logical and temporal operators,
   and these operators are extended by nature language synonymies.
   OntoEvent language is of rich expressiveness compared to other
   traditional languages. Based on OntoEvent, We propose an event detection
   model and elaborate its construction procedures. Experimental results
   prove that OntoEvent-based event detection model outperforms other
   selected models in processing efficiency, especially when processing
   multiple complex event ontologies.}},

Abstract = {{From electricity distribution to water management, higher levels of
   efficiency and performance have been attained by the synergy of
   computers, communications, and control. This higher level of
   performance, however, comes at a cost to system security. Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS) have intrinsic vulnerabilities that malicious agents can
   explore in order to harm the integrity of the system. An attacker
   employing deception-based methods seeks to have their target believe an
   incorrect version of reality. This paper describes two anomaly detection
   approaches using, respectively, micro-level and process-level techniques
   which are then combined into one cross-level hypothesis test. The
   process-level (also referred as macro-level) detector uses the physical
   interconnections that exist between the multiple sensors and implements
   a consensus algorithm to determine if one sensor is reporting anomalous
   values. The micro-level detector uses measurements of the integrated
   circuit power supply current draw sampling several times per clock cycle
   to determine if the code running inside the micro-controller of a sensor
   has been altered. One example of a sensor-based deception attack the
   present work focuses on is a simple replay attack launched from one
   sensor within the system that aims to mislead controllers while eluding
   conventional fault detectors. The theoretical performance of the
   proposed method is evaluated in two laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are related to all aspects of human
   life and have become the target of many cyber-attackers. Attacks on
   industrial control systems may not only cause monetary loss, but also
   damage equipment, the environment and hurt staff, such as the Stuxnet
   and the cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid. So the intrusion
   detection of ICS has a great significance. This paper based on the
   intrusion detection by telemetry analysis, optimized the system model,
   captured the communication packets between different nodes in the
   system, then extracted features for machine learning to achieve
   malicious traffic detection, and the attack types are further
   distinguished. Telemetry means that it does not need to enter the
   industrial control system network, but by capturing data packets
   remotely to achieve intrusion detection.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are moving from dedicated
   communications to Ethernet-based interconnected networks, placing them
   at risk of cyber attack. ICS networks are typically monitored by an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), however traditional IDSs do not detect
   attacks which disrupt the control flow of an ICS. ICSs are unique in the
   repetition and restricted number of tasks that are undertaken. Thus
   there is the opportunity to use Process Mining, a series of techniques
   focused on discovering, monitoring and improving business processes, to
   detect ICS control flow anomalies. In this paper we investigate the
   suitability of various process mining discovery algorithms for the task
   of detecting cyber attacks on ICSs by examining logs from control
   devices. Firstly, we identify the requirements of this unique
   environment, and then evaluate the appropriateness of several commonly
   used process discovery algorithms to satisfy these requirements.
   Secondly, the comparison was performed and validated using ICS logs
   derived from a case study, containing successful attacks on industrial
   control systems. Our research shows that the Inductive Miner process
   discovery method, without the use of noise filtering, is the most
   suitable for discovering a process model that is effective in detecting
   cyber-attacks on industrial control systems, both in time spent and
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are process control systems interacting
   with the cyber world. Once connected to the internet, they become prone
   to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the
   data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have
   financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved.
   Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper
   proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System
   through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The
   proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model.
   Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base
   will be first trained using simulated data of the system including
   faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained,
   real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the
   predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge
   base using comparator to detect anomalies. On detection of abnormal
   data, they will then be further identified as faults or attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems complexity and

   networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have
   shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves

   paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection
   in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we
   present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in
   SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for
   anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing
   redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset
   can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models
   were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at
   the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State
   University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of detection and identification of the
   sensor attacks when most sensors are attacked. Sensors can play a key
   role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the
   automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous
   sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing
   information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might
   cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine
   learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of
   sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as
   cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an
   intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on
   Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a
   prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in
   time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement
   Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and
   nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks
   category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then
   systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep
   learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed
   method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned
   ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our
   method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including
   the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously
   attacked.}},

   anomaly detection and diagnosis. Monitoring duration of sub-tasks in the

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the
   absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of
   intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data
   using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
   The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial
   control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult
   task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital
   systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in
   order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious
   activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection,
   sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a
   new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on
   the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering
   mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing
   intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system
   datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting
   suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three
   techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness
   of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.}},

   state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian
   noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on
   both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce
   particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To
   solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection
   and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual
   generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first
   generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using
   statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The
   proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several
   attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its
   statistical performance is also compared with several conventional
   quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the
   transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed
   criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed
   detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and

Abstract = {{Sequential data generated from various sources in a multi-mode
   industrial production system provides valuable information on the
   current mode of the system and enables one to build a model for each
   individual operating mode. Using these models in a multi-mode system,
   one may distinguish modes of the system and, furthermore, detect whether
   the current mode is a (normal or faulty) mode known from historical
   data, or a new mode. In this work, we model each individual mode by a
   probabilistic suffix tree (PST) used to implement variable order Markov
   models (VOMMs) and propose a novel unsupervised PST matching algorithm
   that compares the tree models by a matching cost once they are
   constructed. The matching cost we define comprises of a subsequence
   dissimilarity cost and a probability cost. Our tree matching method
   enables to compare two PSTs in linear time by one concurrent top-down
   pass. We use this matching cost as a similarity measure for k-medoid
   clustering and cluster PSTs obtained from system modes according to
   their matching costs. The overall approach yields promising results for
   unsupervised identification of modes on data obtained from of a physical
   factory demonstrator. Notably we can distinguish modes on two levels of
   granularity, both corresponding to human expert labels, with a RAND
   score of up to 73 \% compared to a baseline of at most 42 \%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm
   (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA)
   is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search
   ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal
   solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive
   proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and
   local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using
   the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA).
   In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve
   the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local
   optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current
   global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local
   optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test
   functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of
   support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion
   detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with
   BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of
   SVM parameters selection.}},

   However, due to the particularity of the industrial control system, the

   this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection algorithm called
   OPSO-BPNN which is suitable for industrial control system. Our algorithm
   optimizes the particle swarm algorithm with nonlinear reduction inertia

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital
   targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data.
   The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems
   in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers
   and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The
   Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most
   accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS.
   However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number
   of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data
   and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we
   introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to
   improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and
   to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the
   following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces
   the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves
   the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\%
   using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively.}},

Abstract = {{European Starlings and other bird's flocks in thousands and even
   millions. Their flocking behaviors attract predators that see such
   collective behavior as an easy target. However, the surprising thing is
   that it is harder to target and capture one in their mist than a lone
   bird. It is easy to target and capture a lone bird than a bird in a
   flock. One of these collective behaviors is the capability of each of
   them to detect a predator. Each one in the flock can detect a predator
   some meters away. The more they are in number, the harder it will be not
   to detect the incoming predator. This paper proposed modelling the same
   approach for securing Industrial Control System (ICS) and in particular
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, this approach
   seen in the flock of birds can be replicated in computer system for
   securing it. Train system was used as a testbed in this paper for data
   collection. Live data from the train system was collected, analyzed and
   some risk points were discovered. This risk points were the entry points
   for anomalies into the system. These are the points that needs securing.
   The model was to show the viability of using the approach as well as
   integrating it on SCADA systems, and the train system was a
   representation of SCADA system. This approach is purely distributed in
   the sense that each bird is capable of detecting a predator. The
   detection of anomalies is based on the location of each bird in the
   system. The bird's environment has cells and each cell has number. The
   maximum number of birds each cell can contain was six. Six birds
   approach was used for the detection and this can be seen in the model.
   Whenever a packet arrives, the first cell that contain six birds will be
   activated for detection. Birds in the cell has numbers and the activity
   is based on the number. The results showed that both known and unknow
   anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) used in industrial plants are
   vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can cause fatal damage to the plants.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor ICS network traffic and
   detect suspicious activities. However, many IDSs overlook sophisticated
   cyber-attacks because it is hard to make a complete database of
   cyber-attacks and distinguish operational anomalies when compared to an
   established baseline. In this paper, a discriminant model between normal
   and anomalous packets was constructed with a support vector machine
   (SVM) based on an ICS communication profile, which represents only
   packet intervals and length, and an IDS with the applied model is
   proposed. Furthermore, the proposed IDS was evaluated using penetration
   tests on our cyber security test bed. Although the IDS was constructed
   by the limited features (intervals and length) of packets, the IDS
   successfully detected cyber-attacks by monitoring the rate of predicted
   attacking packets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design and implementation of a vibration fault
   detection cyber-physical system (VFDCPS) is presented. Vibration fault
   detection is increasingly used in track vibration, bridge vibration and
   other related fields. However, current research reveals some problems
   such as low accuracy of fault detection, few effective in-depth
   calculation of vibration data and fault test methods. Cyber-Physical
   systems (CPSs) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical
   processes. From the CPSs point of view, VFDCPS consists of three layers:
   the monitoring and control layer (MCL), the network layer and the device
   layer. The MCL deals with real-time monitoring and the precise control
   of the system. In the network layer, the CANopen network of field device
   can communicate with the Ethernet of VFDCPS for system's expandability
   and reliability. The device layer copes with collected data by using
   fast Fourier transform (FFT), lowpass filter, etc., which greatly
   improves the system's accuracy and the ability of massive computing.
   This paper also proposes a fault detection algorithm with vibration data
   called Spider which quantifies the criteria of fault evaluation. It is
   shown by test data that our approaches and improvements in design make
   VFDCPS more accurate and reliable in real-time vibration fault
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems are found in industrial and production systems,
   as well as critical infrastructures. Due to the increasing integration
   of IP-based technology and standard computing devices, the threat of
   cyber-attacks on cyber-physical systems has vastly increased.
   Furthermore, traditional intrusion defense strategies for IT systems are
   often not applicable in operational environments. In this paper we
   present an anomaly-based approach for detection and classification of
   attacks in cyber-physical systems. To test our approach, we set up a
   test environment with sensors, actuators and controllers widely used in
   industry, thus, providing system data as close as possible to reality.
   First, anomaly detection is used to define a model of normal system
   behavior by calculating outlier scores from normal system operations.
   This valid behavior model is then compared with new data in order to
   detect anomalies. Further, we trained an attack model, based on
   supervised attacks against the test setup, using the naive Bayes
   classifier. If an anomaly is detected, the classification process tries
   to classify the anomaly by applying the attack model and calculating
   prediction confidences for trained classes. To evaluate the statistical
   performance of our approach, we tested the model by applying an
   unlabeled dataset, which contains valid and anomalous data. The results
   show that this approach was able to detect and classify such attacks
   with satisfactory accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Modbus over TCP/IP is one of the most popular industrial network
   protocol that are widely used in critical infrastructures. However,
   vulnerability of Modbus TCP protocol has attracted widely concern in the
   public. The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some
   intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper,
   we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is
   designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic.
   SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep
   inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the
   characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic
   relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep
   inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection.
   Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our
   SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
   networks control critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear
   facilities, and water supply systems. These systems are increasingly the
   target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with
   successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and
   injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced
   tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a
   number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we
   study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source
   intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS,
   Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats
   against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control
   protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the
   performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its
   performance in low performance hardware systems.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are found in critical infrastructure
   such as for power generation and water treatment. When security
   requirements are incorporated into an ICS, one needs to test the
   additional code and devices added do improve the prevention and
   detection of cyber attacks. Conducting such tests in legacy systems is a
   challenge due to the high availability requirement. An approach using
   Timed Automata (TA) is proposed to overcome this challenge. This
   approach enables assessment of the effectiveness of an attack detection
   method based on process invariants. The approach has been demonstrated
   in a case study on one stage of a 6stage operational water treatment
   plant. The model constructed captured the interactions among components
   in the selected stage. In addition, a set of attacks, attack detection
   mechanisms, and security specifications were also modeled using TA.
   These TA models were conjoined into a network and implemented in UPPAAL.
   The models so implemented were found effective in detecting the attacks
   considered. The study suggests the use of TA as an effective tool to
   model an ICS and study its attack detection mechanisms as a complement
   to doing so in a real plant-operational or under design.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems - systems that incorporate physical devices with
   cyber components - are appearing in diverse applications, and due to
   advances in data acquisition, are accompanied with large amounts of

   such systems vulnerable to faults and intrusions, motivating the
   development of a general model that can efficiently and continuously
   monitor a cyber-physical system. To be of practical value, the model
   should be adaptive and equipped with the ability to detect changes in
   the system. This paper makes three contributions: (1) a new adaptive
   modeling framework for monitoring an arbitrary cyber-physical system in
   real-time using a flexible statistical distribution called the
   normal-gamma; (2) a novel streaming validation procedure, demonstrated
   on data streams from a cyber-physical system at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory, to justify the use of the normal-gamma and our new adaptive
   modeling approach; and (3) a new online change detection algorithm
   demonstrated on synthetic normal-gamma data streams.}},

Abstract = {{We outline an anomaly detection method for industrial control systems
   (ICS) that combines the analysis of network package contents that are
   transacted between ICS nodes and their time-series structure.
   Specifically, we take advantage of the predictable and regular nature of
   communication patterns that exist between so-called field devices in ICS
   networks. By observing a system for a period of time without the
   presence of anomalies we develop a base-line signature database for
   general packages. A Bloom filter is used to store the signature database
   which is then used for package content level anomaly detection.
   Furthermore, we approach time-series anomaly detection by proposing a
   stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based softmax classifier
   which learns to predict the most likely package signatures that are
   likely to occur given previously seen package traffic. Finally, by the
   inspection of a real dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system,
   we show that an anomaly detection scheme combining both approaches can
   achieve higher performance compared to various current state-of-the-art
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that
   allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In
   the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information
   bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units;
   however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as
   internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give
   more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible
   cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These
   attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a
   country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system
   for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on
   SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning
   techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control
   devices. A support vector of type ``Class One{''} machine and a test
   lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{State of power system is often determined by taking simultaneous
   measurements across the grid. However, in developing countries with
   geographically expansive grid, if the measurements are not GPS
   timestamped there are latencies owing to distance of sensor from control
   center or communication system performance. The latency and resulting
   time-skews in data fed as input to state estimator program may either be
   removed as bad data and also result in lack of convergence or poor state
   estimation. This research report describes a novel approach to detect
   and correct of time-skewed SCADA data which would help Stateestimator
   with (a) more measurements data that would otherwise be discarded by
   bad-data detection module and (b) accurate time-aligned data to make a
   reliable estimation of Power system state.}},

Abstract = {{Within the frame of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as
   Industry 4.0, industrial cyber-physical production systems (ICPS) have
   experienced a significant progress. To this end, Industry 4.0 has
   brought upon an improved, flexible, and cost-efficient system
   architecture that can sustain the development of innovative applications
   and services. Nonetheless, this technological advancement also exposed
   ICPS to significant cyber threats. This paper contributes to the
   development of a cross-layer anomaly detection system (ADS) for ICPS by
   defining a lightweight detection methodology that leverages
   Dempster-Shafer's ``Theory of Evidence{''} in order to: infer the
   system's state; fuse evidence from a wide range of monitored parameters;
   and deliver a comprehensive and scalable detection system. The proposed
   approach is validated in the context of a real natural gas
   transportation installation.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex
   system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important
   because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable
   environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a
   precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging
   task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection
   method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium
   management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method
   by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers
   with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers
   indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected
   failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to
   the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of
   functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method
   did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition,
   our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of
   operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding
   anomalies, but there is still room for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are being widely deployed in
   security-critical scenarios such as smart homes and medical devices.
   Unfortunately, the connectedness of these systems and their relative
   lack of security measures makes them ripe targets for attacks.
   Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to
   be effective for securing CPSs. Unfortunately, deriving invariants for
   capturing the specifications of CPS systems is a tedious and error-prone
   process. Therefore, it is important to dynamically monitor the CPS
   system to learn its common behaviors and formulate invariants for
   detecting security attacks. Existing techniques for invariant mining
   only incorporate data and events, but not time. However, time is central
   to most CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data
   and events, is essential for achieving low false positives and false
   negatives.
   This paper proposes ARTINALI, which mines dynamic system properties by
   incorporating time as a first-class property of the system. We build
   ARTINALI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for two CPSes, namely
   smart meters and smart medical devices, and measure their efficacy. We
   find that the ARTINALI-based IDSes significantly reduce the ratio of
   false positives and false negatives by 16 to 48\% (average 30.75\%) and
   89 to 95\% (average 93.4\%) respectively over other dynamic invariant
   detection tools.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the potential of deep learning for real-time
   detection of cyber-physical attacks on water distribution systems. Deep
   learning methods represent the state-of-the-art of artificial
   intelligence, and they have been successfully employed for solving
   classification and regression problems in many fields of engineering. We
   focus on AutoEncoders (AE), which are multi-layered artificial neural
   networks trained to reconstruct their own inputs. During the training
   process, the weights of the AE are tuned to minimize the reconstruction
   error computed for all training patterns. This entails that when used on
   new input data, anomalous patterns containing outliers are coarsely
   reproduced by the AE-with a corresponding higher reconstruction error.
   When employed for attack detection on water distribution systems, the AE
   are trained to map the status of the network by using the readings of
   the deployed sensors as both inputs and outputs of the model. If the
   training data are representative of normal operations, the AE return
   high reconstruction errors when fed with sensor readings recorded during
   the course of an attack. The detection performance is evaluated on a
   test dataset featuring several classes of plausible attacks-simulated
   with EPANET-and quantified with two evaluation criteria accounting for
   detection accuracy, false alarms and the time needed to identify a
   threat. We also carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect
   of data availability and model complexity on AE detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{Automated monitoring and operation of modern Water Distribution Systems
   (WDSs) are largely dependent on an interconnected network of computers,
   sensors, and actuators that are jointly coordinated by a Supervisory
   Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Although the implementation
   of such embedded systems enhances the reliability of the WDS, it also
   exposes it to cyber-physical attacks that can disrupt the system's
   operation or compromise critical information. Hence, the development of
   attack detection algorithms that can efficiently diagnose and identify
   such assaults is crucial for the successful application of these
   automated systems. In this study, we developed an algorithm to identify
   anomalous behaviors of the different components of a WDS in the context
   of the Battle of the Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL). The
   algorithm relies on using multiple layers of anomaly detection
   techniques to identify both local anomalies that affect each sensor
   individually, as well as global anomalies that simultaneously affect
   more than one sensor at the same time. The first layer targets finding
   statistical outliers in the data using simple outlier detection
   techniques. The second layer employs a trained artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) model to detect contextual anomalies that does not
   conform to the normal operational behavior of the system. The third
   layer uses principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the
   high-dimensional space occupied by the given set of sensor measurements
   into two sub-spaces representing normal and anomalous network operating
   conditions. By continuously tracking the projections of the data
   instances on the anomalous conditions subspace, the algorithm identifies
   the outliers based on their influence on the directions of the principal
   components. The proposed approach successfully predicted all of the
   pre-labeled attacks in the validation data set with high sensitivity and
   specificity. However, for all the detected attacks, the algorithm
   maintained a false `` under attack{''} status for a few hours after the
   threat no longer existed.}},

Abstract = {{The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, brings
   many advantages including innovative applications and services, new
   technologies and advanced features, increased operational benefits, and
   reduced installation costs. However, this technological advancement also
   exposes several challenges pertaining to the development of
   cyber-physical industrial architectures, resilient communication
   systems, and secure data exchange. This paper develops a systematic
   methodology for designing intrusion detection systems (IDS) specially
   tailored to address the cyber and physical dimensions of these systems.
   The approach is aimed at reducing the number of monitored parameters by
   adopting a three-phase design strategy embracing sensitivity analysis,
   cross-association, and optimal IDS design. To this end, phase 1 embraces
   sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive variables to specific
   interventions (e.g., control signals and cyber attacks), phase 2 adopts
   the cross-association assessment to optimally structure the process
   variables in groups that are the most sensitive to groups of
   interventions, and finally, phase 3 optimally assigns the most sensitive
   process variables to IDS, while enforcing the IDS capacity limitations
   and redundancy requirements. Numerical results on a realistic vinyl
   acetate monomer process show that the approach can reduce the number of
   variables by 76.8\%, thus reducing the complexity and the costs of the
   detection infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of seven methods for detecting stealthy attacks on Cyber

   Amigobot robot was used as the CPS. The experiments were conducted in

   attacks were implemented: surge, bias, and geometric. Two variations of
   Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method for detecting attacks were evaluated:
   partial and full physics. Four attack scenarios were implemented.
   Results from the experiments indicate that stealthy attacks could remain
   undetected by the CUSUM methods for some attack scenarios. In addition
   to the CUSUM-based methods, a set of five methods to complement CUSUM
   were implemented and their effectiveness assessed. While the additional
   methods do improve the effectiveness of CUSUM-based methods, some
   attacks remained undetected regardless of which method, or a combination
   of methods, was used for detection due to the amount of variation in
   sensor measurements between different runs in simulation and in the

Abstract = {{Smart grid infrastructure is an integration of advanced communication,
   sensing and computing techniques into the existing physical electrical
   grid. It is emerging as a critical cyber-physical system (CPS)
   infrastructure. CPS comes across as systems with a tight integration
   between the physical and the cyber layers in addition to the
   communication network. This exposes it to a risk of mis-operation when
   subjected to false or malicious data injection from intruders or
   adversaries. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a data
   analytics based cyber defense strategy of a substation automation system
   (SAS) by developing an intelligent module which uses Support vector
   machine (SVM) along with Principal component analysis (PCA). We propose
   a two stage approach for detecting the false data injection by an
   intruder into the system. First stage reduces the high dimensional
   dataset to a lower dimension using PCA and the second stage uses SVM on
   the reduced dataset for detecting the malicious attempts of introducing
   false data into the system. The proposed module uses the measurement
   values received from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Upon receiving
   a fault signal, the protection system initiates checks on incoming data
   patterns and compares it with the behavior of system dynamics. Using
   data analytics tools the fault condition signaling is classified as
   actual (real) fault or false (fake) fault with malicious intentions. The
   proposed methodology is demonstrated on three bus power network.}},

   heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the
   foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most
   important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others
   data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing
   with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high
   as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these
   restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data
   that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier
   detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a
   Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed
   methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important
   events that affect the system.}},

Abstract = {{Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have posed a major security and
   safety threat on commercial and mission-critical systems. In this paper,
   we propose to develop a comprehensive counterfeit ICs detection and
   prevention strategy, consisting of an innovative multi-functional
   on-chip sensor and a related post-fabrication authentication
   methodology. We target at many counterfeit ICs including the
   recycled/remarked/out-of-spec ICs, as well as cloned and over-produced
   ICs. First, the new sensor consists of antifuse memory and aging sensors
   to reduce reference circuit related area overhead of those sensor
   circuits. Second, the new sensor combines both the ring-oscillator based
   aging sensor with recently proposed electromigration(EM)-based aging
   sensor so that it can be effective for estimation of both short and long
   period time of chip usage. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a
   new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent
   non-defective counterfeit ICs. Simulation results show the advantage of
   the proposed multifunctional sensor against existing on-chip sensors in
   terms of functionality, detection coverage and usage time estimation
   range and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In security standards, operation log of Cyber Physical System (CPS)
   should be periodically reviewed to uncover those attacks that were not
   detected by Industrial Intrusion Detection System (IIDS). In this
   review, security experts may find some attack samples; however this
   manual process is not practical considering the large number of samples
   in log. In addition, in sophisticated cyber-attacks such as Stuxnet
   worm, determining normal samples with high confidence can be
   complicated. Hence, a semi-supervised dataset with only some positive
   samples (attacks) is available. In this paper, a statistical method for
   detecting attacks in such datasets is proposed. To the best of our
   knowledge, this work is the first try on detecting attacks in semi
   supervised datasets in industrial settings. This method, which is called
   SADCPS, assumes that attack samples are significantly different from
   normal ones in several features. These features are identified by
   Welch's statistical t-test. Each discriminative feature decides whether
   a sample is attack or not. Then for each sample, weighted voting is
   performed on the results of discriminative features and attack index is
   calculated. Thus, security experts instead of searching all samples,
   only inspect samples with higher attack indexes. For evaluations, a milk
   pasteurization process with almost 50 I/Os (features) were simulated and
   its normal operation and operation under attack were logged for several
   periods. Results indicated that given only few attacks, SADCPS assigns
   most of the first ranks (higher attack indexes) to attack samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with cyber-physical attack detection problem in
   networked control systems subject to limited communication bandwidth.
   This constraint arises when an attack detection system is located at a
   remote site and so the required signals, measurement output and control
   signals, need to be transmitted over a digital communication channel.
   Therefore, data before being sent to the remote site must be encoded and
   converted from analog signals to digital signals by using quantizer. A
   quantizer maps the amount of information from a continuous space to a
   finite set which is compatible with the limited communication bandwidth.
   Considering the quantized measurement output, a detection algorithm by
   means of a set-membership filtering approach will be proposed. The
   algorithm consists of a prediction ellipsoid set and an estimation
   ellipsoid set updated with the quantized measurement output. The
   detection method depends on the existence of intersection between two
   sets computed by the filter. Simulation results for some possible
   physical and cyber attacks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum industry has started to embrace the advanced Petroleum
   Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technologies. Offshore petroleum CPS is
   particularly difficult to build, mainly due to the challenge in
   detecting and preventing offshore oil leaking. During the oil
   exploration and transportation process, the remote multi-sensing
   technology is typically used for leak detection, enabling the underwater
   modeling of an offshore petroleum CPS. However, such a technology
   suffers from insufficient remote sensing resources and large
   computational overhead. In this work, a cross entropy optimization based
   leak detection technique is proposed to detect the oil leak, which also
   facilitates the understanding of the oil leak induced marine pollution.
   Experimental results on a real Penglai oil spill event demonstrate that
   the proposed technique can effectively identify the sources of oil
   spills with accuracy of up to 90.78\%.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and
   control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater
   interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication
   systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage

   vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect,
   created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers.
   Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely
   implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical
   systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise
   of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that
   defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets.
   This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyber-defensive

   technology, particularly those relating to information systems'
   technologies for the collection and processing of real-time data, have
   introduced a large number of new threats. These threats are primarily
   related to the specific tasks these applications perform, such as their
   distinct design specifications, the specialized communication protocols
   they use and the heterogeneous devices they are required to
   interconnect. In particular, specialized attacks can undertake
   mechanical control, dynamic rearrangement of centrifugation or
   reprogramming of devices in order to accelerate or slow down their
   operations. This may result in total industrial equipment being
   destroyed or permanently damaged. Cyber-attacks against Industrial
   Control Systems which mainly use Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) combined with Distributed Control Systems are
   implemented with Programmable Logic Controllers. They are characterized
   as Advanced Persistent Threats. This paper presents an advanced Spiking
   One-Class Anomaly Detection Framework (SOCCADF) based on the evolving
   Spiking Neural Network algorithm. This algorithm implements an
   innovative application of the One-class classification methodology since
   it is trained exclusively with data that characterize the normal

Abstract = {{The critical infrastructure, which includes the electric power grid,
   railroads and water treatment facilities, is dependent on the proper
   operation of industrial control systems. However, malware such as
   Stuxnet has demonstrated the ability to alter industrial control system
   parameters to create physical effects. Of particular concern is malware
   that targets embedded devices that monitor and control system
   functionality, while masking the actions from plant operators and
   security analysts. Indeed, system security relies on guarantees that the
   assurance of these devices can be maintained throughout their lifetimes.
   This paper presents a novel approach that uses timing-based side channel
   analysis to establish a unique device fingerprint that helps detect
   unauthorized modifications of the device. The approach is applied to an
   Allen Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controller where execution
   time measurements are collected and analyzed by a custom anomaly
   detection system to detect abnormal behavior. The anomaly detection
   system achieves true positive rates of 0.978-1.000 with false positive
   rates of 0.033-0.044. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of
   using timing-based side channel analysis to detect anomalous behavior in
   programmable logic controllers. Published'by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Certain mechanical and electrical components, such as generators,
   exhibit degradation phenomena, which may develop slowly over time or
   suddenly. The current trend in this field of research is to develop
   malfunction detection indicators from analog signals recorded by
   operation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), creating
   behavioral models of the equipment and the development of a series of
   status indicators. These models and indicators are used to detect
   malfunctions when operation SCADA are unable to detect an abnormality,
   thus determining that the component is beginning to degrade when certain
   normal limits are exceeded. However, the digital signals from operation
   SCADA have great potential for providing additional information that
   could be used to detect possible malfunction. Detection must be
   accompanied by a study of the remaining life of a component so that the
   remaining useful life of the component before failure can be estimated
   before losing its functionality. If SCADA can detect a malfunction and
   determine when the component will break, the operator will have valuable
   time to intervene prior to failure at an optimum time. This is
   particularly important in installations with difficult access, such as
   offshore wind farms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advancement in sensing and networking technology enhances the capability
   of mechatronic systems by many folds and improves the way it interacts
   with its physical environment. However, the dependency on network
   technology introduces a new set of challenges. Vehicular cyber-physical
   system (VCPS) is one such example that came into existence with the
   objective of enhancing road safety and convenience. In VCPS, the safety
   applications rely on the correctness of the kinematics information
   received from other vehicles in the vicinity. Incorrect kinematics
   information may result in increase in road hazards and creates more
   confusion than convenience. Irrespective of the reasons, detection of
   such errant nodes in VCPS is imperative. Moreover, the trust estimation
   of the nodes can play an important role to classify them as genuine and
   errant. In this work, an efficient scheme is proposed for trust
   estimation and detection of those errant nodes that disseminate
   incorrect kinematics information in VCPS. Simulations using ns-2 and
   VanetMobiSim under realistic vehicular network environment are conducted
   to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results are
   encouraging and reveal that the proposed scheme is suitable for
   implementation in real vehicular environment for detection of such
   errant nodes with high accuracy. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Embedded Systems (CPESs) are distributed embedded systems
   integrated with various actuators and sensors. When it comes to the
   issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of
   Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the
   security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has
   become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power,
   storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for
   wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile,
   ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in
   industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these
   problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID)
   techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect
   malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence
   of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to
   achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing
   detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems
   (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In
   addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium
   and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can
   both reduce energy consumption by up to 50\% compared with the existing
   All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10\% to
   15\% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.}},

   we propose a Dirichlet-based detection scheme, where a Dirichlet-based
   probabilistic model is built to assess the reputation levels of LAs.
   Initial reputation levels of the LAs are first trained using the
   proposed model, based on their historical operating observations. An
   adaptive detection algorithm with reputation incentive mechanism is then
   employed to detect opportunistic attackers. We demonstrate the utility
   of our proposed scheme using data collected from the IEEE 39-bus power
   system with the PowerWorld simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by
   the electric utility industry to monitor and control electric power
   generation, transmission and distribution are recognized today as
   critical components of the electric power delivery infrastructure. SCADA
   systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely
   distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection
   mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great
   importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This
   defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate,
   since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the
   intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated
   detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed
   in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system
   (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an
   intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the
   integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations
   based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   crucial in maintaining safe operation of cyber-physical systems. This
   study investigates the problem of unexpected cyber attack and its
   automatic recovery. First, detectability of attacks based on linear
   system theory is explored and some sufficient conditions of detecting
   state attacks and sensor attacks, respectively, are established.
   Subsequently two adaptive sliding mode observers with on line parameter
   estimation are designed to estimate state attacks and sensor attacks
   separately. Second, appropriate residual signals are constructed and it
   is shown that they approach to the attacks with ultimately uniformly
   bounded errors. Finally, as an illustration of attack detection and
   reconstruction, the results are applied to an IEEE 39 bus power system

Abstract = {{Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is proving to be a
   useful tool for characterization and quantification of metallic
   nanoparticles. However, the short (200-400 mu s) transient signals
   generated by single particle events have to date presented challenges to
   current instrumentation and methodologies. Minimum dwell times are
   available commercially at 50-100 mu s timings but limitations in
   sensitivity for quadrupole ICP-MS make analysis of particles below 10 nm
   diameter difficult. A further limitation of ICPMS when using smaller
   dwell times is the available dynamic range. Typically, a simultaneous
   detector, as used with most ICP-MS has a maximum count ceiling of
   similar to 3 x 10(6) cps which equates to only 150 counts for a 50 mu s
   dwell. This work will present data acquired on a magnetic sector ICP-MS
   with GHz ppm(-1) sensitivities using dwell times down to 10 mu s and
   requiring no hardware modifications. This work will demonstrate the
   advantages obtained with the ability to measure fast transient signals
   with count rates in excess of 3 x 10(7) cps. A further range extension
   facility based on physical attenuation of the ion beam will be
   demonstrated which allows the same faster dwell times to be used for
   signals in excess of 1 x 10(9) cps. A novel data processing technique
   will be described, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous
   techniques when fixed particle signal widths and compliance with ideal
   Poisson statistics for error correction have been assumed. Data will be
   presented to show the non-ideal behaviour of ion cloud signals from
   nano-particles and the measurable impact of these behaviours on the
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Chemosensors have attracted increasing attention for their usefulness
   on-site detection and monitoring. In this study, we elucidated a novel,
   facile, and highly selective Chemo-Paper-Sensor (CPS) for detection and
   monitoring of strontium (Sr2+) ions, which means a potent colorimetric
   sensor based on a Chrysoidine G (CG)-coated paper strip. The CPS for
   highly selective colorimetric detection of strontium ion was handily
   analyzed to determine the red-green-blue (RGB) value using portable
   devices such as desktop digital scanner and mobile phone camera,
   quantitatively. Interestingly, an orange to dark orange color transition
   was observed when the aqueous and solid paper colorimetric sensor was
   introduced to Sr2+ ion, respectively. It was demonstrated that the value
   of the signal has a linear relationship with concentrations of the
   strontium in the 500 ppm to 100 ppb range with a detection limit of 200
   ppb. We believe that a newly developed Chemo-Paper-Sensor will be useful
   in a wide range of sensing applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have recently become an important research
   field not only because of their important and varied application
   scenarios, including transportation systems, smart homes, surveillance
   systems, and wearable devices but also because the fundamental
   infrastructure has yet to be well addressed. Wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs), as a type of supporting infrastructure, play an irreplaceable
   role in CPS design. Specifically, secure communication in WSNs is vital
   because information transferred in the networks can be easily stolen or
   replaced. Therefore, this paper presents a novel distributed low-storage
   clone detection protocol (LSCD) for WSNs. We first design a detection
   route along the perpendicular direction of a witness path with witness
   nodes deployed in a ring path. This ensures that the detection route
   must encounter the witness path because the distance between any two
   detection routes must be smaller than the witness path length. In the
   LSCD protocol, clone detection is processed in a nonhotspot region where
   a large amount of energy remains, which can improve energy efficiency as
   well as network lifetime. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
   lifetime, storage requirements, and detection probability of our
   protocol are substantially improved over competing solutions from the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an early fault detection system for the generator cooling
   of wind turbines is presented and tested. It relies on a hybrid model of
   the cooling system. The parameters of the generator model are estimated
   by an extended Kalman filter. The estimated parameters are then
   processed by an appropriate statistical change detection algorithm in
   order to detect faults in the cooling system. To validate the method, it
   has been tested on 3years of historical data from 43 turbines. During
   the testing period, 16 faults occurred; 15 of these were detected by the
   developed method, and one false alarm was issued. This is an improvement
   compared with the current system that gives 15 detections and more than
   10 false alarms. In some cases, the method detects the fault a long time
   before the turbine reports an alarm. A further advantage of the method
   is that it is based on supervisory control and data acquisition data
   that are available for the operator of all modern turbines. Thereby, the
   method can be implemented without the need to modify or install
   additional components in the turbines. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used ``air-gap{''}
   security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from
   other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect.
   Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers
   who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the
   air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little
   to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This
   paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network
   attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted
   through the network but is not inherently the data used by the
   transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the

Abstract = {{In recent years, the number of information security incidents of
   industry controlling system has increased dramatically. The intrusion
   detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive
   attention. As one of powerful and light weight Network Intrusion
   Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and
   can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency
   on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an
   important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP
   is very important for the industry controlling systems which use
   Profinet to connect. To realize the detection for Profinet RT signal,
   this paper expanded the snort packet decoding engine, and designed a
   preprocessor plug-ins for Profinet RT signal. Experimental result shows
   that the improved Snort can support the intrusion detection for Profinet
   RT signal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with false signal injection attack detection
   mechanism using a novel distributed event-triggered filtering for cyber
   physical systems over sensor networks. By the Internet of Things, the
   classic physical systems are transformed to the networked cyber physical
   systems, which are built with a large number of distributed networked
   sensors. In order to save the precious network resources, a novel
   distributed event-triggered strategy is proposed. Under this strategy,
   to generate the localized residual signals, the event-triggered
   distributed fault detection filters are proposed. By Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional theory, the distributed fault detection filtering problem can
   be formulated as stability and an H-infinity performance of the residual
   system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived such that the
   resultant residual system is stable while the transmission of the
   sampled data is reduced. Based on this condition, the codesign method of
   the fault detection filters and the transmission strategy is proposed.
   An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Devices that monitor and measure various system parameters or physical
   phenomena form an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Such devices
   usually operate continuously and gather important data that is often
   critical for the operation of the underlying system. Thus, it becomes
   important to understand and detect abnormal or malicious device
   behavior, false injection of data by an adversary, or other security
   threats that may lead to incorrect measurement data. This paper
   addresses the problem of detection of anomalies in diurnal traffic
   volume data in an intelligent transportation system. The proposed
   approach leverages the statistical properties of the data to perform
   anomaly detection by calculating the `local density' of the data points.
   Anomalous behavior in the traffic volumes reported by road segments is
   calculated based on sparse local density of the data points. Our
   approach for detecting anomalies does not require any information about
   the outside factors which might have influenced the data. The proposed
   approach has been evaluated on attacks simulated on transportation data
   collected by the New York State Department of Transportation. The
   proposed approach also extends to other cyber-physical systems where the
   monitored data exhibits diurnal patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial realize that SCADA System was built without considering the
   security aspect. It was believe that there will be no attacks go to the
   SCADA plant using malware, such as botnet. Botnets are now the key
   platform for many Internet attacks, such as spam, distributed
   denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing. Most of the
   current botnet detection approaches work only on specific botnet command
   and control (C\&C) protocols (e.g., IRC) and structures (e.g.,
   centralized), and can become ineffective as botnets change their C\&C
   techniques. In this research, we study vertexnet malware attack on a
   SCADA Server so that it can identify a SCADA Operator machine. The
   identification was used by analyzing and comparing process list which is
   run on the infecting host, so the attacker didn't take the wrong target,
   taking over the SCADA and sending some command to disrupt or operate the
   plant or machine, and to identifying of Botnet Vertexnet function and
   activity. From the experiment conducted, we get result that botnet
   Vertexnet can identifying SCADA Operator, taking over the server, and
   the activity can be detected effectively and efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{A network of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs) can use wireless

   fault detection technique is applied to detect and track fault data
   injection attacks on the cooperative adaptive cruise control layer of a
   platoon of connected vehicles in real time. A decision support system
   was developed to reduce the probability and severity of any consequent

Abstract = {{Increasing number of physical systems being connected to the internet
   raises security concerns about the possibility of cyber-attacks that can
   cause severe physical damage. Signature-based malware protection can
   detect known hazards, but cannot protect against new attacks with
   unknown attack signatures. Anomaly detection mechanisms are often used
   in combination with signature-based anti-viruses, however, they too have
   a weakness of triggering on any new previously unseen activity, even if
   the activity is legitimate. In this paper, we present a solution to the
   problem of protecting an industrial process from cyber attacks, having
   robotic manufacture facilities with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) as
   our use case. Our solution combines detection of danger signals with
   anomaly detection in order to minimize mis-labelling of legitimate new
   behaviour as dangerous.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for detecting replay attacks on cyber-physical systems is
   presented in this paper. The diagnosis system under a replay attack will
   not trigger an alarm as long as the received sensor readings are
   plausible. Since an adversary is not able to react on system changes due
   to the simplicity of the attack and a lack of system knowledge, our goal
   is to excite the system in non-regular time intervals. Subsequently we
   can check by means of signal processing whether the received sensor
   readings are valid. To excite harmonic oscillations, we insert a
   nonlinear element in the control loop and exploit the theory of
   describing functions. Since the nonlinear function is a design
   parameter, we are able to design robust harmonic oscillations. Another
   advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility of elegant
   implementation into existing control systems.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to detect covert attacks and zero dynamics attacks on
   cyber-physical systems is presented in this paper. These attack
   strategies are very sophisticated and rely on perfect system knowledge.
   The resulting attack signal is completely invisible in the sensor
   readings. Hence an ordinary fault diagnosis system is not able to detect
   such attacks and to trigger an alarm. Our goal is to insert a modulation
   matrix in the path of the control variables. By altering the input
   behavior of the process, the adversary will lose his perfect system
   knowledge and therefore his attacks can be revealed. We design the
   modulation matrix by focusing on covert attacks. By guaranteeing that
   the modulation changes the input directions, we unmask zero dynamics
   attacks as well, since multivariable zeros depend on frequency and
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an important clinical
   problem of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which incurs
   approximately 90\% of all TBI-related costs. However, current detection
   approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria,
   paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already
   overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed
   recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we
   design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for
   early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First,
   a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria.
   With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and
   integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our
   system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to
   relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and
   provide timely decision supports. Evaluations on 107 clinical cases
   extracted from medical publications demonstrate the effectiveness and
   the efficiency of our integrated system.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a process-oriented method for intrusion detection for
   use on Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. Network traffic from an
   ICS has a much lower volume than that from a typical IT enterprise
   network, and the traffic is much more regular (periodic) and
   predictable. Most intrusion detection systems for ICSs require
   additional capabilities. ICS network traffic is relatively predictable
   and regular and anomaly-based intrusion detection methods have been
   shown in the literature to work reasonably well. We use anomaly-based
   methods as one line of defense. We propose to strengthen ICS intrusion
   detection methods by adding two process-oriented alerting methods.
   Unlike most anomaly detection methods, these two methods are not
   configured solely by a network engineer based on inspection of network
   traffic. We utilize Critical Process Variables, which are defined by the
   plant operators themselves. The advantage is that the plant operators
   have the best knowledge of the critical assets of their system. Limiting
   values of the Critical Process Variables are defined collaboratively by
   the plant operator and the network security engineer. A network sensor
   then alerts a Human Analyst when Critical Process Variables values
   exceed the defined ranges. We also introduce a third method, which
   employs Process Network Parameter Metrics, which are also defined
   collaboratively with the plant operator. Process Network Parameter
   Metrics are pre-defined measurements from network traffic that may
   indicate that either process components are missing or there is
   additional traffic present that the process should not normally produce.
   After initial discussions with the plant operator, the network security
   engineer designs network models and metrics with appropriate alerting
   functions in the network sensor. Alerts from Process Network Parameter
   Metrics may not indicate a critical security incident as Critical
   Process Variables would, but they may provide an important warning that
   suspicious behavior is present.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are used to control chemical processes, and
   can be found in manufacturing, civil infrastructure, energy industry,
   transportation and in many more places. There is one common
   characteristic in these areas, their operation is critical as a
   malfunction can potential be life-threatening. In the past, an attack
   against the cyber part of the systems can lead to physical consequences.
   The first well known attack against a CPS was Stuxnet in 2010. It is
   challenging to develop countermeasures in this field without endangering
   the normal operation of the underlying system. In our research, our goal
   was to detect attacks without interfering with the cyber physical
   systems in any way. This can be realized by an anomaly detection system
   using passive network monitoring. Our approach is based on analysing the
   state of the physical process by interpreting the communication between
   the control system and the supervisory system. This state can be
   compared to a model based prediction of the system, which can serve as a
   solid base for intrusion detection. In order to realize our intrusion
   detection system, a testbed was built based on widely used Siemens PLCs.
   Our implementation consists of three main parts. The first task is to
   understand the network communication in order to gain information about
   the controlled process. This was realized by analysing and deeply
   understanding the publicly undocumented Siemens management protocol. The
   resulting protocol parser was integrated into the widely-used Bro
   network security monitoring framework. Gathering information about the
   process state for a prolonged time creates time series. With these time
   series, as the second step, statistical models of the physical process
   can be built to predict future states. As the final step, the new states
   of the physical process can be compared with the predicted states.
   Significant differences can be considered as an indicator of compromise.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
   Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is highly
   periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to multi-threaded
   scheduling.
   In previous work we introduced a Statechart model which includes
   multiple Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), one per cyclic pattern. We
   demonstrated that Statechart-based anomaly detection is highly effective
   on multiplexed cyclic traffic when the individual cyclic patterns are
   known. The challenge is to construct the Statechart, by unsupervised
   learning, from a captured trace of the multiplexed traffic, especially
   when the same symbols (ICS messages) can appear in multiple cycles, or
   multiple times in a cycle. Previously we suggested a combinatorial
   approach for the Statechart construction, based on Euler cycles in the
   Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) graph of the trace. This combinatorial
   approach worked well in simple scenarios, but produced a false-alarm
   rate that was excessive on more complex multiplexed traffic.
   In this paper we suggest a new Statechart construction method, based on
   spectral analysis. We use the Fourier transform to identify the dominant
   periods in the trace. Our algorithm then associates a set of symbols
   with each dominant period, identifies the order of the symbols within
   each period, and creates the cyclic DFAs and the Statechart.
   We evaluated our solution on long traces from two production ICS: one
   using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol and the other using Modbus. We also
   stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated
   traces that simulate multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of
   symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The resulting Statecharts model the
   traces with an overall median false-alarm rate as low as 0.16\% on the
   synthetic datasets, and with zero false-alarms on production S7-0x72
   traffic. Moreover, the spectral analysis Statecharts consistently
   out-performed the previous combinatorial Statecharts, exhibiting
   significantly lower false alarm rates and more compact model sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems
   (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such
   as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and
   specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they
   often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost
   solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively
   polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could
   fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices
   (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be
   resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which
   are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these
   challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring
   approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors
   specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS,
   SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness
   of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity
   of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks
   at a rate of 99\%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of
   81-93\%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating
   few attack scenarios generating false negatives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hierarchical monitoring intrusion detection
   system (HAMIDS) for industrial control systems (ICS). The HAMIDS
   framework detects the anomalies in both level 0 and level 1 of an
   industrial control plant. In addition, the framework aggregates the
   cyber-physical process data in one point for further analysis as part of
   the intrusion detection process. The novelty of this framework is its
   ability to detect anomalies that have a distributed impact on the
   cyber-physical process. The performance of the proposed framework
   evaluated as part of SWaT security showdown (S3) in which six
   international teams were invited to test the framework in a real
   industrial control system. The proposed framework outperformed other
   proposed academic IDS in term of detection of ICS threats during the S3
   event, which was held from July 25-29, 2016 at Singapore University of
   Technology and Design.}},

Abstract = {{With technology advancing faster than ever and complex systems present
   in most of the areas of our lives ensuring security has become a
   critical issue. Protecting data from unwanted access by modifying it
   through cryptography, hiding data or digitally signing it are some of
   the solutions available. Just as important however is to detect and
   prevent attacks. We propose a system with hierarchical access to data
   which is gained through a digital signature algorithm. We focus our
   attention on detecting and preventing attacks through a less
   conventional method - complex event processing. Any action within the
   cyber-physical system can be viewed as an event, such as digitally
   signing a message. With this idea in mind we propose a solution that
   allows designing a secure cyber-physical system with an efficient attack

   rapidly change detection patterns and adjust detection functions,
   meeting the needs of 19 kinds electrical devices test and quality
   inspection, with the advantages of efficiency, flexibility,

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) uses Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., 3D
   Printers) that are vulnerable to kinetic cyber-attacks. Kinetic
   cyber-attacks cause physical damage to the system from the cyber domain.
   In AM, kinetic cyber-attacks are realized by introducing flaws in the
   design of the 3D objects. These flaws may eventually compromise the
   structural integrity of the printed objects. In CPS, researchers have
   designed various attack detection method to detect the attacks on the
   integrity of the system. However, in AM, attack detection method is in
   its infancy. Moreover, analog emissions (such as acoustics,
   electromagnetic emissions, etc.) from the side-channels of AM have not
   been fully considered as a parameter for attack detection. To aid the
   security research in AM, this paper presents a novel attack detection
   method that is able to detect zero-day kinetic cyber-attacks on AM by
   identifying anomalous analog emissions which arise as an outcome of the
   attack. This is achieved by statistically estimating functions that map
   the relation between the analog emissions and the corresponding cyber
   domain data (such as G-code) to model the behavior of the system. Our
   method has been tested to detect potential zero-day kinetic
   cyber-attacks in fused deposition modeling based AM. These attacks can
   physically manifest to change various parameters of the 3D object, such
   as speed, dimension, and movement axis. Accuracy, defined as the
   capability of our method to detect the range of variations introduced to
   these parameters as a result of kinetic cyber-attacks, is 77.45\%.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often
   initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying
   sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical
   damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against
   cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in
   detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For
   this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference
   implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect
   attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order
   to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset
   created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State
   University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and
   cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance
   metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall;
   accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate
   may change significantly when considering various attack types and
   different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also
   provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably
   real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical

Abstract = {{Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they
   control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including
   electric power, oil \& gas and others. The protocols used in this domain
   were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much
   consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today
   have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks,
   leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the
   physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to
   improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are
   typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended
   with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is
   its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial
   support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on
   existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic
   rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple
   language grammar allows network engineers to describe system
   characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of
   the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with
   SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates
   network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS.
   An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system
   changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring
   needs.}},

   signatures so that misuse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can
   subsequently thwart attacks of the same type. Our experimental results
   indicate that our honeypot and the signatures it generates provide good
   detection accuracy and that the Bro IDS can successfully use the
   signatures to prevent future attacks.}},

   reference datasets made available by other researchers. These datasets
   refer to real industrial networks and contain a variety of identified

   anomaly detection is proposed. Supervisory control and data acquisition
   system (SCADA) data of a wind turbine is adopted and several parameters
   are selected based on physic knowledge and correlation coefficient
   analysis to build a normal behavior model. This model is based on
   Self-organizing map (SOM) which can project higher dimensional SCADA
   data into a two-dimension-map. After that, the Euclidean distance based
   indicator for system level anomalies is defined and a filter is created
   to screen out suspicious data points based on quantile function.
   Moreover, a failure data pattern based criterion is created for anomaly
   detection from system level. The method is tested with a two-month SCADA
   dataset with the measurement interval as 20 seconds. Results demonstrate
   capability and efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital
   component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in
   SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking
   mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when
   increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the
   system security, but few of them can effectively resist response
   injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper
   we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the
   periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical
   SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in
   SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing
   an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect
   response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the
   network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered
   simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection,
   especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed
   system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching
   severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is
   polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of our IDS mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{In the engineering of cyber-physical systems the engineering process
   typically focuses on single systems and not on the entire system
   network. Within the system network the different specification artifacts
   (in consequence also the implemented systems) for the various
   cyber-physical systems evolve independently even though they highly
   interact with each other. As a result, inconsistencies between the
   different specification artifacts can emerge. An inconsistency implies
   that at least one artifact is incorrect. Following, specification
   inconsistencies among single cyber-physical systems within an entire
   system network endanger correct functioning of the network. Hence, it is
   of importance to identify all existing inconsistencies and to correct
   the corresponding artifacts. Therefore, this paper suggests a solution
   concept for supporting the identification and repair of inconsistencies
   in interaction-based specification artifacts. The approach relies (i) on
   the automated detection of inconsistencies among overlapping
   specification artifacts of different systems participating in the same
   cyber-physical network, and (ii) on the automated proposal of valid
   solution options to aid the engineers in decision making w.r.t.
   resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we apply the solution idea
   to ITU message sequence charts as a typical notation format for
   interaction-based behavioral specification artifacts of cyber-physical
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large
   variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they
   are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong
   connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new
   data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing
   such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature
   extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for
   discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of
   a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn
   system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The
   results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions
   is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for
   anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes
   with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and
   an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems are critical to the infrastructure of a country.
   They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of
   off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on
   World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated
   their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network
   security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead
   to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the
   departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to
   build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time
   to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning
   intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the
   physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate
   of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment
   facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits
   a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model
   can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of networks within an organization made many critical
   infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that
   were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet.
   CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more
   sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore
   it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them,
   thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To
   specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we
   propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the
   intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could
   be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known
   vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be
   identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning
   component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and
   correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the
   specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then
   security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable
   configurations on critical infrastructure network devices.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA traffic between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the
   Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be highly periodic.
   However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling.
   Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed SCADA streams using
   Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically
   produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. In this paper we
   introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our
   Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern,
   together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic
   into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We evaluated
   our solution on traces from a production SCADA system using the Siemens
   S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our solution on a collection of
   synthetically-generated traces. In all but the most extreme scenarios
   the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm rate and
   the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA model.}},

Abstract = {{The cyber security problem is posing new challenges to the current
   safety analysis of nuclear power plants. Historically, analogue control
   systems in the absence of interactive communications are immune to
   cyber-attacks; however, digital control systems with extensive
   interconnection of reprogrammable components are intensely vulnerable to
   cyber-attacks which shed light on the significance and urgency of the
   cyber security. The current cyber security approaches, which merely
   focus on information networks, have not given multifaceted
   considerations to instrumentation and control (I\&C) systems. The
   cyber-attack on I\&C systems may lead to more severe consequences,
   including the abnormal change of parameters, the malfunction of
   equipment, and even the accident condition. The existing cyber security
   approaches for information networks, such as firewalls, encryption, can
   enhance the cyber security of I\&C systems, but are often insufficient
   in addressing challenges associate with the I\&C systems which link
   cyber space and physical systems. The defense approach based on physical
   information should be developed to meet the emerging challenges. In this
   paper, we propose the cyber-physical security (CPS) approach based on
   the physical process data for the cyber defense. This approach does not
   intend to replace current cyber defense mechanisms. It could be served
   as the last barrier for security defense. The goal of the CPS defense
   approach is to detect attacks at the beginning of the occurrence of
   physical process anomalies cause by cyber-attacks. A practical
   implementation of the CPS approach is proposed and its influence on the
   existing infrastructure is discussed. The statistical analysis
   techniques are utilized on physical process data for attack detection.
   The method of dynamic principal component analysis (dynamic PCA) is
   employed to characterize the correlation of multiple variables in the
   normal operational condition. In the abnormal operational occurrence,
   the chi-square detector is able to distinguish adversarial cyber-attacks
   from ordinary random failures.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine failure and downtime can often compromise the profitability
   of a wind farm due to their high impact on the operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) costs. Early detection of failures can facilitate the changeover
   from corrective maintenance towards a predictive approach. This paper
   presents a cost-effective methodology to combine various alarm analysis
   techniques, using data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system, in order to detect component failures. The approach
   categorises the alarms according to a reviewed taxonomy, turning
   overwhelming data into valuable information to assess component status.
   Then, different alarms analysis techniques are applied for two purposes:
   the evaluation of the SCADA alarm system capability to detect failures,
   and the investigation of the relation between components faults being
   followed by failure occurrences in others. Various case studies are
   presented and discussed. The study highlights the relationship between
   faulty behaviour in different components and between failures and
   adverse environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel domain-aware anomaly detection system that
   detects irregular changes in Modbus/TCP SCADA control register values.
   The research discovered the presence of three classes of registers: (i)
   sensor registers; (ii) counter registers; and (iii) constant registers.
   An automatic classifier was developed to identify these classes.
   Additionally, parameterized behavior models were created for each class.
   During its learning phase, the anomaly detection system used the
   classifier to identify the different types of registers and instantiated
   the model for each register based on its type. During the enforcement
   phase, the system detected deviations from the model. The anomaly
   detection system was evaluated using 131 h of traffic from a production
   SCADA system. The classifier had a true positive classification rate of
   93\%. During the enforcement phase, a 0.86\% false alarm rate was
   obtained for the correctly-classified registers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The main aim of this paper is to provide intensive solution for heart
   attack through Cyber Physical System (CPS). Cyber Physical System is one
   of the blooming technologies with wide range of applications. Currently
   the interest towards design and implementation of CPS is highly
   increasing. It is expected that CPS will play a vital role in the
   progress of upcoming embedded systems. In this paper we have proposed a
   system to provide efficient and quick solution to heart attack patients
   who are at great risk. Advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
   (MEMS) technology has created an enormous impact on the current medical
   health care scenario. It has enabled the design of small sized wireless
   communication systems at low cost. A small wearable wireless monitoring
   system inspects the patient's ECG signals continuously and transmits the
   signals to decision making and control systems. The control system is
   capable of controlling the actuation system which is fitted to the body
   of the patients. The warning system sends an alert in case of emergency
   to the caretakers mobile. Our proposed system uses low cost, energy
   efficient and reliable zigbee technology for communication among the
   physical components and hence the effectiveness of the system is
   improved. This life saving system reduces the mortality rate of heart
   patients and it act as an effective heart care service to patients.}},

Abstract = {{Energy theft has been a serious and long existing problem facing by many
   power utilities. The implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure
   (AMI) provides power companies with new means for energy theft
   detection. As fundamental equipment of AMI, smart meters collect
   interval measurements from customer sites and thus provide system wide
   visibility for power companies. Leveraging both AMI and SCADA
   measurements, this paper puts forward an integrated distribution state
   estimation method for medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution
   network. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can achieve a
   higher accuracy level for estimation. Furthermore, an energy theft
   detection method is proposed based on ``weight-dropped polling{''}
   integrated distribution state estimation. Simulations show that it can
   deliver promising results comparing with conventional state estimation

Abstract = {{As the maliciousness and frequency of cyber-attacks continues to grow,
   the safety and security of cyber-physical critical infrastructures, such
   as manufacturing, is quickly becoming a significant concern across the
   globe. Outside of traditional intellectual property theft, attacks
   against manufacturing systems pose a threat to maintaining a product's
   design intent. More specifically, such attacks can alter a manufacturing
   system to produce a part incorrectly; resulting in impaired
   functionalities or reduced performance. Manufacturing systems rely
   heavily upon the use of quality control systems to detect quality losses
   and to ensure the continued production of high-quality parts. However,
   quality control systems are not designed to detect the effects of
   malicious attacks and are ill-suited to act as a cyber-security measure
   for many manufacturing systems. Therefore, this paper presents a novel
   product/process design approach to enable real-time attack detections to
   supplement the shortcomings of quality control systems. The proposed
   approach, inspired by side-channel schemes used to detect Trojans
   (foreign malicious logic) in integrated circuits, aims at detecting
   changes to a manufactured part's intrinsic behavior through the use of
   structural health monitoring techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are employed to monitor and
   control safety-critical industrial processes. A Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is an ICS to perform centralized
   monitoring and also to control field sites in long-distance
   communication networks. A SCADA is a distributed system composed of
   several Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and a Master Terminal Unit (MTU).
   RTUs interface with field sensors, local control devices, and field
   actuators, and the MTU gathers data from RTUs, provides an operator
   interface to display information, and controls remote sites. RTUs are
   typically connected to the MTU through a client/server network. Since
   RTUs operate commonly in a harsh industrial environment, fault tolerance
   is a key requirement, especially for safety-critical industrial
   processes. Studies show that a significant number of transient faults
   caused by a harsh environment lead to control flow errors in the RTU's
   processors. A control flow checking technique, called PLC-CFC, has been
   proposed to detect control flow errors in several RTUs in a SCADA
   system. The proposed technique can be applied to all ICSs which employ
   microcontrollers, microprocessors, PLCs, or personal computers as their
   RTUs. The proposed technique has been experimentally evaluated on a real
   ICS consists of some PLC devices and a main server. For experimental
   evaluation, 30,000 faults were injected on distributed system and the
   PLC-CFC technique detected more than 96.76\% of the injected faults. The
   performance and the memory overheads of the technique are about 18.12\%
   and 16.17\% on average, respectively.}},

   that skilled attackers can strike critical infrastructures by leveraging
   knowledge about these processes. Sequence attacks subvert infrastructure
   operations by sending misplaced industrial control system messages. This
   chapter discusses four main sequence attack scenarios against industrial

Abstract = {{The counterfeiting and recycled integrated circuits (ICs) has become a
   major security threat for commercial and military systems. In addition
   to the huge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety
   threats on those systems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight
   on-chip aging sensor, which is based on the electromigration
   (EM)-induced aging effects for fast detection and prevention of recycled
   ICs. Our new EM-based aging sensor exploits the natural aging/failure
   mechanism of interconnect wires to time the aging of the chip. Compared
   with existing aging sensor, the new aging sensor can provide more
   accurate prediction of the chip usage time at smaller area footprints
   due to its simple structure. The new sensor is based on a newly proposed
   physics-based stress evolution model of EM effects for accurate
   prediction of the EM failure. As a result, we can design the
   interconnect wire structures based on copper interconnect technology so
   that the resulting wires will have detectable EM failure at a specific
   time with sufficient accuracy. In order to mitigate the problem of the
   inherent variations in the metal grain sizes and assess its impacts on
   the nucleation time of metal wires, a number of parallel properly
   structured wires are used in the sensor. The parameters of the wires are
   optimized using the new EM model. Our statistical and variational
   analysis shows that the proposed aging sensor can accurately predict the
   targeted failure times in the presence of both inherent uncertainties.
   Our study also shows that more parallel wires will lead to more accurate
   statistical predictions at costs of more areas.}},

Abstract = {{A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is an
   Industrial Control System (ICS) which controls large scale industrial
   processes including several sites over long distances and consists of
   some Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and a Master Terminal Unit (MTU). RTUs
   collect data from sensors and control actuators situated at remote sites
   and send data to the MTU through a network. Since RTUs operate in a
   harsh industrial environment, fault tolerance is a key requirement
   particularly for safety-critical industrial processes. Studies show that
   a significant number of transient faults due to a harsh environment
   result in control flow errors in the RTU's processors. A software error
   detection technique has been proposed to detect control flow errors in
   several RTUs. For experimental evaluation 30,000 faults injected on
   network; the average performance and memory overheads are about 33.20 \%
   and 36.79 \%, respectively and this technique detected more than 96.32
   \% of injected faults.}},

Abstract = {{A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (i.e.,
   sensors) with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context
   sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in
   real-world situations. A core element of CPS is the collection and
   assessment of information from noisy, dynamic, and uncertain physical
   environments that must be transformed into usable knowledge in
   real-time. Machine learning algorithms such as cluster analysis can be
   used to extract useful information and patterns from data generated from
   physical devices based on which novel applications of CPS can make
   informed decisions. In this paper we propose to use a density-based data
   stream clustering algorithm, built on the Multiple Species Flocking
   model, for the monitoring of big data, generated from numerous
   applications such as machine monitoring, health monitoring, sensor
   networks. In the proposed approach, approximate results are available on
   demand at anytime, so it is particularly apt for real life monitoring
   applications. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of ICS, PLC and SCADA systems are interconnected
   with Ethernet and directly connected to internet, which greatly improve
   the efficiency of data sharing and introduced in security threats at the

   result in casualties and great economic loss. Peach Fuzzer is an
   advanced and extensible fuzzing platform and is restricted to those with
   TCP/UDP-based protocols on Windows Platform, the PN-DCP would not be
   supported without publisher to send PDU correctly. So it is urgent to
   develop an additional publisher for PN-DCP. In this paper, we propose a
   novel Peach improvement on Profinet-DCP for industrial control system
   vulnerability detection. We analyze the importance of vulnerability
   detecting for PN-DCP with Peach Fuzzer. Then, introducing the Peach
   Framework, the hierarchy of Profinet-DCP and the PitFile of
   Profinet-DCP. We also evaluate our approach through experiments, the

Abstract = {{ICS (Industrial Control System) is a computer-controlled system that
   monitors and controls distributed field devices for power grid, water
   treatment and other industrial areas. Because ICS components fulfill
   their own roles, the network traffic of ICS has obvious regular
   patterns. These patterns can be used effectively in monitoring ICS
   network and detecting signs of cyber-attacks. In our previous work, we
   proposed a burst-based anomaly detection method for DNP3 protocol using
   the regularity of ICS network traffic. Traffic monitoring method such as
   switch mirroring causes many problems; packet duplication, packet
   out-of-order, and packet loss. The problems cause many false alarms.
   Furthermore, it is hard to decide whether the alarms caused by lost
   packets are true or false. In this paper, we apply our burst-based
   approach to TCP protocol in SCADA network and propose a method to manage
   monitoring problems for burst-based anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze a behavior-rule specification-based technique for
   intrusion detection of medical devices embedded in a medical cyber
   physical system (MCPS) in which the patient's safety is of the utmost

   state machine, so that a device that is being monitored for its behavior
   can easily be checked against the transformed state machine for
   deviation from its behavior specification. Using vital sign monitor
   medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion
   detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high
   detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden
   attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications. Moreover,
   through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our behavior-rule
   specification-based IDS technique outperforms two existing anomaly-based
   techniques for detecting abnormal patient behaviors in pervasive

Abstract = {{World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric
   grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application
   areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised
   concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition
   (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming
   needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which
   are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some
   disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the
   intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an
   integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel ``What-if{''}
   module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal.
   This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the
   system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer
   and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually
   clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these
   work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the
   proposed `` What-if{''} module.}},

Abstract = {{Malicious tampering of the internal circuits of ICs can lead to
   detrimental results. Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system
   behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This
   paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection.
   It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a
   design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering
   algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other
   algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We
   neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the
   effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the
   output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this
   information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub
   benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The
   results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100\%
   coverage with low false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a Concurrent Hardware Trojan Detection (CHTD) methodology
   for wireless cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs), based on
   continuous extraction of a side-channel fingerprint and evaluation by a
   trained on-chip neural classifier. While similar statistical
   side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the
   past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically,
   during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be
   easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times
   except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology
   operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is,
   therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is
   demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a
   custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware
   Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a
   Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and
   (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC.
   Experimental results corroborate that the proposed CHTD methodology
   effectively identifies hardware Trojans when they are active, while not
   incurring any false positives when they are absent or dormant.}},

Abstract = {{Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems.
   Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence
   the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is
   impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks.
   A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in
   the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack
   scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power
   systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed
   consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal
   Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI)
   etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial
   communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3.The proposed
   testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting
   potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to
   send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from
   the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in
   reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher
   security measures.}},

Abstract = {{Defects in through-silicon vias (TSVs) due to fabrication steps decrease
   the yield and reliability of 3-D stacked integrated circuits, and hence
   these defects need to be detected early to reduce chip's DPM. In this
   paper, a new fault detection and repair method for TSVs in 3D-ICs is
   proposed. The contribution of the method is to detect stuck-at-faults
   and delay-based fault in TSV by a scan-based built-in self-test (BIST)
   architecture. This test architecture supports both pre-bond and
   post-bond TSV testing. By constructing RC model and analyzing the delay
   characteristics of TSV, the variation of TSV-to-substrate resistance
   caused by TSV defects can be mapped to the change of path delay so that
   the related fault can be detected. Based on the test architecture, we
   propose a TSV redundancy structure to repair circuit after failed TSVs
   are detected. Results of fault detection effectiveness are presented
   through ModelSim simulations using realistic models under 65 nm CMOS
   technology. And redundancy design leads to 99.9846\% recovery rate for
   TSVs with only 0.2\% redundancy rate of TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in real-time systems is a problem without a profound
   solution. In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
   the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of
   intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes
   regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system.
   An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is
   distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion
   detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and
   the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits
   traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of
   OCSVM models. These trained models run in parallel and can accurately
   and fast recognise different types of attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical
   processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
   physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
   affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the
   eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the
   President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will
   be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial
   control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random
   failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their
   growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect
   for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion
   detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any
   harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined
   universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism
   remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss
   how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in
   this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to
   define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the
   intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the
   layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some
   significant research problems are identified for enlightening the
   subsequent studies.}},

Abstract = {{The massive use of information and communication technologies in
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways
   for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying
   on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the
   heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for
   traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has
   become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very
   severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious
   intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and
   firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for
   intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification
   algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated:
   1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel
   principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is
   examined in detail with the study of l(p)-norms in radial basis function
   (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the
   bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data
   with several types of cyberattacks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hemolysis is the main cause of non-quality samples in
   clinical laboratories, producing the highest percentage of rejections in
   the external assurance programs of preanalytical quality. The objective
   was to: 1) study the agreement between the detection methods and
   quantification of hemolysis; 2) establish comparable hemolysis
   interference limits for a series of tests and analytical methods; and 3)
   study the preanalytical variables which most influence hemolysis
   production.
   Methods: Different hemoglobin concentration standards were prepared
   using the reference method. Agreement was studied between automated
   methods {[}hemolytic indexes (HI)] and reference method, as well as the
   interference according to hemolysis degree in various biochemical tests
   was measured. Preanalytical variables which could influence hemolysis
   production were studied: type of extraction, type of tubes, transport
   time, temperature and centrifugation conditions.
   Results: Good agreement was obtained between hemoglobin concentrations
   measured using the reference method and HI, for the most of studied
   analyzers, particularly those giving quantitative HI. The hemolysis
   interference cut-off points obtained for the majority of tests studied
   (except LDH, K) are dependent on the method/analyzer utilized.
   Furthermore, discrepancies have been observed between interference
   limits recommended by the manufacturer. The preanalytical variables
   which produce a lower percentage of hemolysis rejections were:
   centrifugation at the extraction site, the use of lower volume tubes and
   a transport time under 15 min at room temperature.
   Conclusions: The setting of interference limits (cut-off) for each used
   test/method, and the study of preanalytical variability will assist to
   the results harmonization for this quality indicator.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a core part
   of industrial systems, such as smart grid power and water distribution
   systems. In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber
   attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly
   detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the
   development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to
   counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an
   automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA
   data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity
   detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase,
   the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is
   adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal
   inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from
   consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known
   fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract
   proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative
   data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training
   data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as
   simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide
   significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared
   to three well-known anomaly detection approaches. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The increased interconnectivity and complexity of supervisory control

   mitigate varied cyber-attack threats. The multiattribute IDS comprises a
   heterogeneous white list and behavior-based concept in order to make
   SCADA cybersystems more secure. This paper also proposes a multilayer
   cyber-security framework based on IDS for protecting SCADA cybersecurity

   addition, this paper presents a SCADA-specific cybersecurity testbed to
   investigate simulated attacks, which has been used in this paper to

Abstract = {{The counterfeiting and recycling of integrated circuits (ICs) have
   become major issues in recent years, potentially impacting the security
   and reliability of electronic systems bound for military, financial, or
   other critical applications. With identical functionality and packaging,
   it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused
   ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are
   proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when
   used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring
   oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques
   presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis
   is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the
   sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based
   sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to
   record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or
   switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design.
   Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm
   test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification
   of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in
   AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short
   period, can be accurately identified.}},

   summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension's options. We also
   summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial cause of urinary tract
   infections. Its rapid and specific identification in urine samples
   represents a major challenge within the rendering results and optimizing
   the management of the patient. We aimed to compare the sensitivity and
   specificity,of two commercially available chromogenic media for E. coli:
   ChromID CPS (R) (Biomerieux) and UriSelect4 (R) (Bio-Rad), without
   carrying out further tests. 99 consecutive and non-redundant urine
   samples considered to be infected were simultaneously plated onto blood
   agar and the two chromogenic media. Colony color and bacterial growth
   quantification were compared 18 and 48 hours after incubation. Bacteria
   were identified with mass spectrometry. A complementary analysis on 80
   bacterial strains known to pose potential identification problems was
   performed. 43 urines samples grew E. coli, and 42 of them were
   pink-colored on the two chromogenic mediums, as expected
   (sensibility=97.7\%). Growth quantification was significantly greater on
   blood agar than on chromogenic media (p<0.001).We noted specificity
   issues at the complementary analysis with the UriSelect4 (R) medium:
   Citrobacter freundii and some strains of Citrobacter brakii,
   Enterobacter cloacae and Hafnia alvei were pink-colored, and could be
   misidentified as E. coli. ChromID CPS (R) medium did not show such
   misidentification. In conclusion, the agar ChromID CPS (R) proved to be
   greater than the UriSelect4 (R) agar in our work in terms of specificity
   of direct identification of E. Coli, without the use of additional test.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalies in cyber-physical systems may arise due to malicious cyber
   attacks or operational faults in the physical devices. Accurately
   detecting the anomalies and isolating their root-causes is important for
   identifying appropriate reactive and preventive measures and building
   resilient cyber-physical systems. Anomaly detection and isolation in
   cyber-physical systems is challenging, because the impact of a cyber
   attack on the operation of a physical system may manifest itself only
   after some time. In this paper, we present a Bayesian network approach
   for learning the causal relations between cyber and physical variables
   as well as their temporal correlations from unlabeled data. We describe
   the data transformations that we performed to deal with the
   heterogeneous characteristics of the cyber and physical data, so that
   the integrated dataset can be used to learn the Bayesian network
   structure and parameters. We then present scalable algorithms to detect
   different anomalies and isolate their respective root-cause using a
   Bayesian network. We also present results from evaluating our algorithms
   on an unlabeled dataset consisting of anomalies due to cyber attacks and
   physical faults in a commercial building system.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are
   designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with
   other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last
   years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to
   attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its
   normal operation.
   In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of
   detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support
   Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering.
   The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of technology used in operation, monitoring, and
   control introduces several threats against power system. Cyber-physical
   power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of
   attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and
   attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers
   require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for
   simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such
   a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction
   to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the
   development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems.
   The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital
   simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a
   MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a
   platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system
   attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers.
   Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are
   implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system
   {[}11]. Fault, contingency and cyber-attack scenarios have been
   developed for both power systems. Selected relevant simulation results

   detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an

Abstract = {{Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCI), involving cyber and
   physical systems, are exposed to intelligent cyber attacks targeting the
   stable operation of these systems. In order to ensure anomaly awareness,
   the observed data can be used in accordance with data mining techniques
   to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Anomaly Detection
   Systems (ADS). There is an increase in the volume of sensor data
   generated by both cyber and physical sensors, so there is a need to
   apply Big Data technologies for real-time analysis of large data sets.
   In this paper, we propose a clustering based approach for detecting
   cyber attacks that cause anomalies in NCI. Various clustering techniques
   are explored to choose the most suitable for clustering the time-series
   data features, thus classifying the states and potential cyber attacks
   to the physical system. The Hadoop implementation of MapReduce paradigm
   is used to provide a suitable processing environment for large datasets.

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and
   control physical processes associated with the critical infrastructure.
   Weaknesses in the application layer protocols, however, leave SCADA
   networks vulnerable to attack. In response, cyber security researchers
   have developed myriad intrusion detection systems. Researchers primarily
   rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traffic data
   sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads
   to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the
   results, cannot compare the effectiveness of different intrusion
   detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of
   intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks.
   Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to
   compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper
   describes four data sets, which include network traffic, process control
   and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two
   laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the MODBUS
   application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available,
   enable effective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced false data injection attack in targeted malware intrusion is
   becoming an emerging severe threat to the Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) system. Several intrusion detection schemes have
   been proposed previously {[}1, 2]. However, designing an effective
   real-time detection system for a resource-constraint device is still an
   open problem for the research community. In this paper, we propose a new
   relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection
   attacks at the SCADA system, even when injected data may seemly fall
   within a valid/normal range. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we
   design a novel detection model, alternation vectors with state relation
   graph. Furthermore, we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the
   injection point(s), i.e., the attack origin, in the system. We evaluate
   SRID with a real-world power plant simulator. The experiment results
   show that SRID can detect various false data injection attacks with a
   low false positive rate at 0.0125\%. Meanwhile, SRID can dramatically
   reduce the search space of attack origins and accurately locate most of
   attack origins.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and localization of damage in a timely manner is critical
   in order to avoid the failure of structures. When a structure is
   subjected to an unscheduled impulsive force, the resulting damage can
   lead to failure in a very short period of time. As such, a monitoring
   strategy that can adapt to variability in the environment and that
   anticipates changes in physical processes has the potential of
   detecting, locating and mitigating damage. These requirements can be met
   by a Structural Control (SC) system that is capable of measuring and
   analyzing dynamic responses in real time. Such a system requires an
   effective damage identification method capable of locating and
   quantifying damage. The Eigenparameter Decomposition (ED) of Structural
   Flexibility Change method is validated with real data and can be used in
   the computational core of this system. The condition screening is
   implemented on a damaged structure and compared to an original baseline
   calculation, hence providing a supervised learning environment. A
   laboratory-scale experimental study on a 5-story shear building with
   different damage conditions subjected to an impulsive force has been
   chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The
   effectiveness of the ED method to locate damage is compared to that of
   the Damage Index method. The ED method has also been modified to be able
   to locate and quantify damage. The experimental study shows the
   effectiveness of the modified method.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of open and widely used standards led to an increase in the
   grade of exposure and vulnerability in Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Therefore, the development of novel Anomaly
   Detection Systems (ADSs) specifically for SCADA systems is receiving a
   considerable attention from the scientific community. This paper goes
   beyond existing proposals and provides not only a novel ADS, but also a
   novel methodology for automatically configuring Snort-based ADSs
   deployed in SCADA systems. The methodology includes a graphical
   interface, a formal language, and shell scripts, used to model SCADA
   topologies and to automatically generate ADS rules. The approach is
   validated through several experiments and shows good performance with
   large topologies involving 100 LANs, 1000 hosts and 100 ADSs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{As the complexity of cyber-physical systems increases, so does the
   number of ways an adversary can disrupt them. This necessitates
   automated anomaly detection methods to detect possible threats. In this
   paper, we extend our recent results in the field of inference via formal
   methods to develop an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our procedure
   constructs from data a signal temporal logic (STL) formula that
   describes normal system behavior. Trajectories that do not satisfy the
   learned formula are flagged as anomalous. STL can be used to formulate
   properties such as ``If the train brakes within 500 m of the platform at
   a speed of 50 km/hr, then it will stop in at least 30 s and at most 50
   s.{''} STL gives a more human-readable representation of behavior than
   classifiers represented as surfaces in high-dimensional feature spaces.
   STL formulae can also be used for early detection via online monitoring
   and for anomaly mitigation via formal synthesis. We demonstrate the
   power of our method with a physical model of a train's brake system. To
   our knowledge, this paper is the first instance of formal methods being
   applied to anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) employ sensors to observe physical
   environments and to detect events of interest. Equipped with sensing,
   computing, and communication capabilities, Cyber-Physical Systems aim to
   make physical-systems smart(er). For example, smart electricity meters
   nowadays measure and report power consumption as well as critical events
   such as power outages. However, each day, such sensors report a variety
   of warnings and errors: many merely indicate transient faults or short
   instabilities of the physical system (environment). Thus, given the big
   volumes of data, the time-efficient processing of these events,
   especially in large-scale scenarios with hundreds of thousands of
   sensors, is a key challenge in CPSs.
   Motivated by the fact that critical events of CPSs often have
   temporal-spatial properties, we focus on identifying critical events by
   an online temporal-spatial analysis on the data stream of messages. We
   explicitly model the online detection problem as a single-linkage
   clustering on a data stream over a sliding-window, where the inherent
   computational complexity of the detection problem is derived. Based on
   this model, we propose a grid-based single-linkage clustering algorithm
   over a sliding-window, which is an online time-space efficient method
   satisfying the quick processing demand of big data streams. We analyze
   the performance of the proposed approach by both a series of
   propositions and a large, real-world data-set of deployed CPS, composing
   300,000 sensors, over one year. We show that the proposed method
   identifies above 9 5 \% of the critical events in the data-set and save
   the time-space requirement by 4 orders of magnitude compared with the
   conventional clustering method.}},

   that does not need any labeled data for training or any information
   about the kind of anomaly is expecting for the detection process. This
   feature makes it ideal for processing SCADA environment data and
   automate SCADA performance monitoring. The OCSVM module developed is
   trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system
   real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
   system developed under CockpitCI project and communicates with the other
   parts of the system by the exchange of IDMEF (Intrusion Detection

Abstract = {{To design a stable and fully controllable process for conveying steel
   plates with less noise, we have extensively investigated the feasibility
   of incorporating the structure that can provide appropriate extra
   electromagnetic attraction forces. By implementing appropriate fixed
   electromagnetic poles on top of the rollers at the run-out table of a
   steel mill, controllable lift and propulsive forces can thus be provided
   to drive the movable steel plate to the desired 2-D directions. Based on
   the stringent operational environment at a steel mill, an online
   recursive gap detection scheme combined with a real-time fuzzy-based
   controller has been developed. Realization results showed that the
   system, being implemented with the proposed fine-tuned
   processing/control scheme, can supply rapid and accurate online 2-D
   controls onto the steel plates and thus fulfill the design and
   operational objectives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of
   attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal
   pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential
   observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate
   model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one
   fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the
   observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix
   inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme
   is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized
   fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator
   faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our
   particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the
   attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis
   reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting
   physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also
   comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of
   detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a
   successful deception attack.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{63-75}},

Abstract = {{The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for
   communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable
   logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion
   detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The
   approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from
   a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can
   be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An
   algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA
   associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages.
   The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into
   Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This
   approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a
   message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a
   message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection
   approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high
   sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect
   matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven
   PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111 h of operation.
   Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real
   anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the
   HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured
   incorrectly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   capable of leaking the secret key of a wireless cryptographic integrated
   circuit (IC) consisting of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core
   and an Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) transmitter. With its impact carefully
   hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process
   variations, this hardware Trojan cannot be detected by production
   testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and
   does not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level
   specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to
   look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving
   the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block
   sent by the UWB transmitter. Using silicon measurements from 40 chips
   fabricated in TSMC's 0.35 mu m technology, we also assess the
   effectiveness of a side channel-based statistical analysis method in

Abstract = {{The development of electrical control system faults leads to increased
   mechanical component degradation, severe reduction of asset performance,
   and a direct increase in annual maintenance costs. This paper presents a
   highly accurate data driven classification system for the diagnosis of
   electrical control system faults, in particular, wind turbine pitch
   faults. Early diagnosis of these faults can enable operators to move
   from traditional corrective or time based maintenance towards a
   predictive maintenance strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks
   and requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach provides
   transparent, human-readable rules for maintenance operators which have
   been validated by an independent domain expert. Data from 8 wind
   turbines was collected every 10 min over a period of 28 months with 10
   attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Three fault classes are
   identified, each represented by 6,000 instances in each of the testing
   and training sets. Of the turbines, 4 are used to train the system with
   a further 4 for validation. Repeated random sampling of the majority
   fault class was used to reduce computational overheads whilst retaining
   information content and balancing the training and validation sets. A
   classification accuracy of 85.50 \% was achieved with 14 human readable
   rules generated via the RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these, 11 were
   described as ``useful and intuitive{''} by an independent domain-expert.
   An expert system was developed utilising the model along with domain
   knowledge, resulting in a pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05 \%
   along with a 42.12 \% reduction in pitch fault alarms.}},

   TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these
   systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in
   these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking
   authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are
   potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with
   unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because
   labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly
   and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms
   suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that
   can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to
   improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework
   demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion
   detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means
   greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy
   communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security
   vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little
   consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of
   SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes
   signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems.
   The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known
   suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is
   proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally,
   proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are
   implemented and verified via Snort rules.}},

Abstract = {{In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and
   networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of
   closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against
   cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and
   communication/network protocols, and their private networks are
   physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However,
   in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its
   maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure
   against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of
   m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for
   detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion
   detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which
   has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is
   dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with
   pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set
   can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold
   values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference
   model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model
   can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and
   efficiently.}},

   behaviorally and structurally independent of the cyber-portion of a CPS

   CPS sensors. An IC is able to raise an alarm despite communication
   failure or undetected cyber attacks. Strategic placement of one or more

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an integration of physical processes with
   computation and communication. CPS connects the virtual world with
   physical world. It has the ability to add more intelligence to social
   life. A CPS integrates physical devices, such as sensors and cameras,
   with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated
   analytical system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in the
   real-world scenarios. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be a vital part
   of CPS as strong sensing capabilities can be one of the major driving
   factors for CPS applications. Still CPS is considered as a nascent
   technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These
   challenges are often posed due to the complexity of communication,
   computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide
   ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living,
   environmental control and traffic management. Unfortunately, no unified
   architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations
   among the applications. In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of
   medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number
   of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the
   efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few CPS healthcare
   architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all
   lack of efficient false alarm detection. In this paper, a novel false
   alarm detection architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare
   applications. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their
   overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance
   cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous
   monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection
   algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs
   by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by
   eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory
   Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring
   system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is
   a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of
   failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our
   exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault
   detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number
   of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated
   classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal
   components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures
   due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original
   measurements including rotor speeds and produced power.}},

Abstract = {{Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and
   deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small
   amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic
   controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data
   within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system
   failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion
   Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational
   behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm
   filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are
   required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity
   when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks
   are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and
   simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with
   and without the TFIDS.}},

Abstract = {{To design a stable and fully-controllable process for conveying steel
   plate with less noise, feasibility of incorporating the structure that
   can provide appropriate extra electromagnetic attraction forces has been
   extensively investigated. By implementing appropriate fixed
   electromagnetic poles on top of the rollers at the run-out-table of a
   steel mill, controllable lift and propulsive forces can thus be provided
   to drive the movable steel plate to the desired two-dimensional
   directions. Based on the stringent operational environment at a steel
   mill, an on-line recursive gap detection scheme combined with a
   real-time fuzzy-based controller has been developed. Realization results
   showed that the system, being implemented with the proposed fine-tuned
   processing/control scheme, can supply rapid and accurate online 2-D
   controls onto the steel plates and thus fulfill the design and
   operational objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the traffic in industrial control system network is
   markedly different from more open networks. Industrial control system
   networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic
   diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are
   currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning
   based anomaly detection.
   Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial
   control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse
   detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based
   approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for
   different restricted network environments of which an industrial control
   system network is an good example of.
   In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a
   ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both
   control data and the data flowing between the control network and the
   office network. A set of possible features to be used for detecting
   anomalies is studied for this environment.}},

Abstract = {{This article consists of two parts: a theoretical part concerned with
   fault detection schemes, and an application part dealing with cyber
   security of power systems. In the first part, we develop a tractable
   approach to design a robust residual generator to detect and isolate
   faults in high dimensional nonlinear systems. Previous approaches on
   fault detection and isolation problems are either confined to linear
   systems or they are only applicable to low dimensional dynamics with
   more specific structures. In contrast, we propose a novel methodology to
   robustify a linear residual generator for a nonlinear system in the
   presence of certain disturbance signatures. To this end, we formulate
   the problem into the framework of quadratic programming which enables us
   to solve relatively high dimensional systems. In the second part, the
   application is motivated by the emerging problem of cyber security in
   power networks. We provide description of a multi-machine power system
   that represents a two-area power system, and we model a cyber-physical
   attack emanating from the vulnerabilities introduced by the interaction
   between IT infrastructure and power system. The algorithm developed in
   the first part is finally used to diagnose such an intrusion before the
   functionality of the power system is disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{Interconnect imperfections have become an important issue in modern
   nanometer technologies. Some of them cause Small Delay Defects (SDDs)
   which are difficult to detect. Those SDDs not detected during testing
   may pose a reliability problem. Furthermore, nanometer issues (e.g.
   process variations, spatial correlations) represent important challenges
   for traditional delay test methods. In this paper, a methodology to
   compute the Detection Probability (DP) of resistive open and bridge
   defects using a statistical timing framework that takes into account
   process variations and other nanometer issues is proposed. The DP gives
   the sensitivity of the circuit performance to a given resistance range
   of the defect. The efficiency issue when analyzing large circuits is
   alleviated using stratified sampling techniques to reduce the space of
   possible analyzed defect locations This methodology is applied to some
   ISCAS benchmark circuits. The obtained results show the feasibility of
   the proposed methodology. Measures can be taken for those circuits
   presenting non-acceptable DP in order to improve the test quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a generic hierarchical model for performance
   analysis of intrusion detection techniques as applied to a
   cyber-physical system (CPS) consisting of mobile nodes with navigation,
   manipulation, sensing and actuating capability. We develop two intrusion
   detection techniques, namely, positional discontinuity and
   enviroconsistency, for intrusion detection of malicious attackers in a
   CPS. We utilize the hierarchical model developed to analyze the
   performance characteristics of these two techniques and identify optimal
   design settings under which the reliability of the CPS may be maximized.
   The analysis reveals design tradeoffs in security assurance and energy
   consumption, and suggests that enviroconsistency be used over positional
   discontinuity for reliability maximization. Numerical results with
   physical interpretations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The security of critical infrastructures is decreasing due to the
   apparition of new cyber threats against Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The evolution they have experienced; the
   use of standard hardware and software components or the increase of
   interconnected devices in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency,
   have contributed to this. This work reviews the research effort done
   towards the development of anomaly detection for these specific systems.
   SCADA systems have a number of peculiarities that make anomaly detection
   perform better than in traditional information and communications
   technology (ICT) networks. SCADA communications are deterministic, and
   their operation model is often cyclical. Based on this premise, modeling
   normal behavior by mining specific features gets feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a critical
   part of large industrial facilities, such as water distribution
   infrastructures. With the goal of reducing costs and increasing

   However, tins has also exposed them to a wide range of network security
   problems. Our research focus on the development of a novel flow-based
   intrusion detection system. Based on the assumption that SCADA networks
   are well-behaved, we believe that it is possible to model the normal
   traffic by establishing relations between network flows. To improve
   accuracy and provide more information on the anomalous traffic, we will
   also research methods to derive a flow-based model for anomalous flows.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a set of anomaly-detection techniques and their
   applicability to wind turbine fault identification. It explains how the
   anomaly-detection techniques have been adopted to analyse supervisory
   control and data acquisition data acquired from a wind farm, automating
   and simplifying the operators' analysis task by interpreting the volume
   of data available. The techniques are brought together into one system
   to collate their output and provide a single decision support
   environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent
   system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the
   output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the
   accuracy of fault detection. The results presented demonstrate that the
   interpretation techniques can provide performance assessment and early
   fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to
   make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their

   unique characteristics of IACS, in particular their deterministic
   behavior and often available formal system description, to reliably

   of the engine control strategies base on the torque control model, most
   of vehicle need engine brake function. The problem is that with the
   engine brake function some big deceleration is the driver command not

Abstract = {{The failure of non-leaf nodes in Application Layer Multicast (ALM) tree
   partitions the multicast tree, which may significantly degrade the
   quality of multicast service. Accurate and timely failure recovery from
   node failures in ALM tree, which is based on the premise of efficient
   failure detection scheme, is critical to minimize the disruption of
   service. In fact, failure detection has hardly been studied in the
   context of ALM. Firstly, this paper analyzes the failure detection
   issues in ALM and then proposes a model which is based on the
   relationship between parent and child nodes for it. Secondly, the
   Cooperative-Probe based failure detection Scheme (CPS), in which the
   information about probe loss is shared among monitor nodes, is designed
   Thirdly, the performance of CPS is analyzed. The Numerical results show
   that our proposed scheme can simultaneously reduce the detection time
   and the probability of false positive at the cost of little increased
   control overhead by comparing with the Basic-Probe based failure
   detection Scheme (BPS). Finally, some possible directions for the future
   work are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There have been serious concerns recently about the security of
   microchips from hardware trojan horse insertion during manufacturing.
   This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip
   manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important
   consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics,
   communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted
   into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is
   triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload
   error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a
   trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The
   problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few
   works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem
   based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides
   procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to
   detect trojan effects. We also provide experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical industries which are intended for the packaging of
   different tablets in a strip of blister need to make sure that the
   tablets are free from defects before letting them go into the packing
   box. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient, reliable
   and cost effective Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   System for detection and removing of unwanted tablet(s) strips. The
   system detects defective tablets by capturing image of a batch of
   tablets and performs morphological analysis over it. If a defective
   tablet is found, the system is smart enough to trace in which strip the
   defective tablet would be present after cutting of batch and hence
   instructing the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) to remove that strip. The
   status of the whole process at the completion of every order is sent to
   Master Terminal Unit (MTU) which generates and saves the log rile on
   MS-EXCEL, and is also able to send the log rile to main server via

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an anomaly intrusion detection model based on
   shuffle operation and product machines targeting persistent
   interposition attacks on control systems. These attacks actually are
   undetectable by the most advanced system call monitors as they issue no
   system calls and are stealthy enough to transfer control to hijacked
   library functions without letting their saved instruction Pointers get
   stored on stack. We exploit the fact that implementations of control
   protocols running in control systems, which in turn are attached to
   physical systems such as power plants and electrical substations,
   exhibit strong regularities in terms of sequences of function calls and
   system calls issued during protocol transactions. The main idea behind
   the proposed approach is to introduce NULL function calls within a
   Modbus binary and to apply the shuffle operation between them and
   existing function calls. We then devise and implement a product machine
   capable of recognizing the shuffle representation of function call and
   system call regularities. A sensor uses a unidirectional interprocess
   communication channel based on shared memory to receive profile data
   from a Modbus process, and subsequently submits them to the product
   machine. We describe an experimental evaluation of our model on an
   ARM-based Modbus device and demonstrate that the proposed model
   overcomes the limitations of state of the art approaches with regard to
   detection of persistent interposition attacks on control systems.}},

Abstract = {{Pointer taintedness is a concept which has been successfully employed as
   basis for vulnerability analysis of C/C++ source code, and as a run-time
   mitigation technique against memory corruption attacks. Nevertheless,
   pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several
   industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable
   in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of
   those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis
   may have no visibility on certain lowlevel vulnerabilities since there
   may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with
   the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of
   memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of
   industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are
   related to a dynamic organization of data in memory.
   In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access
   taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of
   memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness
   is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of
   implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main
   low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks
   specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of
   memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities.
   We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as
   the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for
   the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities
   in implementations of industrial control protocols.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient defect-oriented parametric test method for analog and

   of a selected circuit's, parameter using wavelet decomposition
   preprocessing is proposed in this paper. The neural network has been
   used for detecting catastrophic defects in two experimental analog and
   mixed-signal CMOS circuits by sensing the abnormalities in selected
   parameters, observed under defective conditions, and by the consequent
   classification of the circuits under test into a proper category.
   Wavelet decomposition is used to perform the preprocessing of input data
   in order to reduce complexity of the neural network significantly.
   Moreover, we show that wavelet analysis brings significant enhancement
   in the correct classification and makes the neural network-based test
   method extremely efficient and versatile potential for detecting
   hard-detectable catastrophic defects in analog and mixed-signal

Abstract = {{Little work has previously been reported on the use of fuzzy logic
   within statistical process control when this is used for fault detection
   as part of quality control systems in industrial manufacturing
   processes. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential use of fuzzy
   logic to enhance the performance of statistical process control (SPC).
   The cumulative sum of the deviation in the monitored parameter is
   combined with the deviation in an attempt to discriminate between false
   alarms and real faults and, consequently, to improve the quality of the
   solution. Combinations of control rules are utilized and trained to cope
   with different inputs such that rejection of false alarms is achieved
   and quick detection of real faults is obtained. The design and
   implementation of this fuzzy expert system (FES) are presented, and a
   comparative rule-based study is performed.}},

Abstract = {{The Vidas ICS/SLM system allows the detection of Salmonella sp. as
   antigens in food in a 4-step procedure: cultural enrichment,
   immunconcentration (TCS), post enrichment, antigen detection (SLM). A
   preliminary result can be obtained at the end of the day following the
   day of arrival of the sample, i.e. in an investigation time of 24 to 28
   hrs. This method was compared to the widely accepted rapid, sensitive
   and low-cost MSRV method. Both methods were applied on frozen as well as
   chilled poultry meat samples. After some modification of the Vidas
   ICS/SLM enrichment protocol, no significant differences between MSRV and
   Vidas SLM were found in 36 chilled and 58 frozen meat samples. The Vidas
   ICS/SLM produced no False positive results.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional testing is based on applying signals to circuit inputs and
   observing logic state of outputs. However; with the introduction of CMOS
   technology a new test technique emerged, that is bared on applying
   signal inputs and observing standby electrical current. This technique
   is known as IDDQ testing. In most CMOS circuits, when all inputs are
   frozen in place and circuit transient activities settle down, the
   current drops by 3-5 orders of magnitude below normal levels. During
   resting, if there is a deviation from this behavior a defect is detected
   While parametric rest of electric current has always been popular
   (including in bipolar and NMOS technologies) to detect short between
   power supply lines, the promise of IDDQ test is that it rc ill also
   allow detection of bridging between signal nets and transistor stuck-on
   faults in CMOS circuits. However; in reality the resolution of the size
   of the defect is limited by the magnitude of stand-by current. Since
   normal process variation can cause shift in stand-by current by two
   orders of magnitude, choosing a single threshold for IDDQ defect
   detection is impractical. Many ideas have been proposed to overcome this
   problem. most of which are based an choosing an adaptive cut-off point
   for a wafer; or a lot. In this paper, we suggest a technique, that in
   concept, is akin to setting an individual cut-off point for a die. The
   concept has been validated based on actual data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we have investigated a unified and simultaneous fault
   detection method for mixed-signal integrated circuits. The method is
   based on the analysis of the power-supply current through the circuit
   under test.
   The analysis has been done paying attention to the dynamic behaviour of
   the power-supply current, in order to avoid measurement problems related
   to the large amount of quiescent current drop across many analog blocks.
   The analysis of the dynamic power-supply current entails certain
   problems related to the complexity of the measurement process,
   especially those due to the high speed of the current transients. These
   problems have been addressed by considering a design for test procedure
   based on the use of built-in dynamic current sensors.
   The goal of the design for test methodology proposed is to represent the
   Iddt through the mixed-signal IC under test by a digital signature. The
   paper presents some advantages of this approach such as a good tolerance
   to crosstalk noise and the need for only a conventional digital tester
   on the complete mixed-signal IC for fault detection. The analysis is
   illustrated with some test results.}},
