Title = {{VHDRA: A Vertical and Horizontal Intelligent Dataset Reduction Approach
   for Cyber-Physical Power Aware Intrusion Detection Systems}},

Abstract = {{The Cypher Physical Power Systems (CPPS) became vital targets for
   intruders because of the large volume of high speed heterogeneous data
   provided from the Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS). The Nonnested
   Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate
   classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However,
   NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input
   features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders
   the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce
   VHDRA, a Vertical and Horizontal Data Reduction Approach, to improve the
   classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and reduce the
   computational resource consumption. VHDRA provides the following
   functionalities: (1) it vertically reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant features and by reducing the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles. (2) It horizontally reduces the size of data while
   preserving original key events and patterns within the datasets using an
   approach called STEM, State Tracking and Extraction Method. The
   experiments show that the overall performance of VHDRA using both the
   vertical and the horizontal reduction reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles
   by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves the accuracy of the NNGE
   by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\% using the Multi-, Binary, and Triple class
   datasets, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are playing important roles in the critical
   infrastructure now. A prominent family of CPSs are networked control
   systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over
   computer networks like the Internet. Communication over insecure
   networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we
   design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on
   system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error
   statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system
   operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it
   significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating
   controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic
   controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on
   a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal
   amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that
   the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator
   is also successful in alleviating the attack effects.}},

Abstract = {{Operational Technology (OT) often refers to the industrial control
   systems which are used to monitor and control the devices and processes
   of critical infrastructure like, water treatment plant, power grid and
   sewage systems. Conventionally, these OT systems are completely isolated
   from Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to protect their
   processes and devices against cyber-attacks. However, the convergence of
   IT and OT is inevitable to improvise the remote management of physical
   devices and to enhance the production by incorporating data-driven
   decision making by accessing and analyzing their real-time data. To
   achieve this, the isolated OT systems and devices need to be accessed
   using Internet. However, this interconnection leads both the sensor and
   control data of OT systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This research
   work extends our previous intrusion detection system that identifies
   anomalies which are deviated from process-invariants in secured water
   treatment (SWaT) test-bed data obtained from Singapore University of
   Technology and Design (SUTD). Additionally, it proposes
   process-invariants based timed automata wherein the attack and its
   detection model are represented as timed automata. The proposed system
   is implemented and validated using UPPAAL, a tool for validating
   real-time systems represented as networks of timed automata. The results
   conclude that the proposed system effectively identifies the attacks
   considered thereby recommending the timed automata as an operational
   tool for detecting the data-integrity attacks in critical
   infrastructures. The highly reported attacks that include level
   indicators, motorized valves, pressure indicators and analyzer
   indicators are detected successfully by the proposed system. Using the
   results, Stage 1 and Stage 3 are highly vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks to Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are detected by Industrial
   Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs). Operation of stage-based CPSs
   (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three
   parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and
   normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art
   IIDSs directly ad-dress cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states
   whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate
   cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to
   detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically
   extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS
   behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field
   layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to
   illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three
   cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process
   indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O
   CPSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Without robust security mechanisms, the smart grid remains vulnerable to
   many attacks that can cause serious damages. Since state estimation is a
   critical entity to monitor and control electricity production and
   distribution, intruders are more attracted by this entity in order to
   disrupt the smart grid reliability. In this context, we propose an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) architecture to detect lethal attacks
   with a focus on two smart grid security issues: (i) Firstly, against
   integrity issue with price manipulation attack, we propose a Cumulative
   Sum (CUSUM) algorithm that detects this attack even with granular price
   changes; (ii) Secondly, the availability issue with Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack against which we develop an efficient method to monitor and
   detect any misbehaving node. Performance evaluations show the robustness
   of the proposed IDS system compared to existing mechanisms. The achieved
   detection rate is above 95\% and the false positive rate is below 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems have recently emerged in several practical
   engineering applications where security and privacy are of paramount
   importance. This motivated the paper and a recent surge of interest in
   development of innovative and novel anomaly and intrusion detection
   technologies. This paper proposes a novel distributed blind intrusion
   detection framework by modeling sensor measurements as the target
   graph-signal and utilizing the statistical properties of the
   graph-signal for intrusion detection. To fully take into account the
   underlying network structure, the graph similarity matrix is constructed
   using both the data measured by the sensors and sensors' proximity
   resulting in a data-adaptive and structure-aware monitoring solution. In
   the proposed supervised detection framework, the magnitude of the
   captured data is modeled by Gaussian Markov random field and the
   corresponding precision matrix is estimated by learning a graph
   Laplacian matrix from sensor measurements adaptively. The proposed
   intrusion detectionmethodology is designed based on a modified Bayesian
   likelihood ratio test and the closed-form expressions are derived for
   the test statistic. Finally, temporal analysis of the network behavior
   is established by computing the Bhattacharyya distance between
   themeasurement distributions at the consecutive time instants.
   Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method and to compare it with that of the state-of-the-art methods. The
   results show that the proposed intrusion detection framework provides a
   detection performance superior to those provided by the other existing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a major concern in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).
   In this paper, an algorithm based on Petri Net (PN) is proposed that
   simultaneously detects misuse and anomaly behavior of the system. The
   proposed anomaly detection method is applicable to Supervisory Control
   and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the highest level of CPSs. Neural
   First Order Hybrid Petri Net model (NFOHPN) with online fast Independent
   Component Analysis (ICA) is proposed for anomaly detection. It is shown
   that the use of distributed and multidisciplinary intrusion detection
   methods in different layers of CPSs increases security of the net
   against coordinated cyber-attacks. Simulation results and comparative
   studies based on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
   evaluation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can detect
   normal or malicious behavior with satisfying accuracy and at
   surprisingly high convergence speed.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasingly widespread application of information and
   communication technology, the smart grid has gradually evolved into a
   cyber physical system characterised by deep integration between the
   information space and physical space. All manner of intrusion attacks on
   cyber physical power systems are growing more and more frequent. Timely
   and accurate detection and identification of these intrusions are
   essential for the effective control and protection of cyber physical
   power systems. For massive and high-dimensional intrusion behaviour data
   in cyber physical power systems, distributed intrusion detection based
   on hybrid gene expression programming and cloud (DID-HGEPCloud)
   computing is proposed. In the DID-HGEPCloud, attribution reduction with
   noise data based on rough set and a global intrusion model based on
   non-linear least squares are applied to improve the efficiency and
   accuracy of intrusion detection. At the same time, the MapReduce
   programming framework of cloud computing is adopted, and parallelisation
   of the model of the proposed algorithm is performed to enhance its
   ability to manage massive and high-dimensional data. Comparative
   experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious
   advantages in terms of false attack rate, DAR, and average time
   consumed. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm possesses excellent
   parallel performance.}},

Abstract = {{The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, brings
   many advantages including innovative applications and services, new
   technologies and advanced features, increased operational benefits, and
   reduced installation costs. However, this technological advancement also
   exposes several challenges pertaining to the development of
   cyber-physical industrial architectures, resilient communication
   systems, and secure data exchange. This paper develops a systematic
   methodology for designing intrusion detection systems (IDS) specially
   tailored to address the cyber and physical dimensions of these systems.
   The approach is aimed at reducing the number of monitored parameters by
   adopting a three-phase design strategy embracing sensitivity analysis,
   cross-association, and optimal IDS design. To this end, phase 1 embraces
   sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive variables to specific
   interventions (e.g., control signals and cyber attacks), phase 2 adopts
   the cross-association assessment to optimally structure the process
   variables in groups that are the most sensitive to groups of
   interventions, and finally, phase 3 optimally assigns the most sensitive
   process variables to IDS, while enforcing the IDS capacity limitations
   and redundancy requirements. Numerical results on a realistic vinyl
   acetate monomer process show that the approach can reduce the number of
   variables by 76.8\%, thus reducing the complexity and the costs of the
   detection infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Embedded Systems (CPESs) are distributed embedded systems
   integrated with various actuators and sensors. When it comes to the
   issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of
   Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the
   security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has
   become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power,
   storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for
   wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile,
   ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in
   industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these
   problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID)
   techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect
   malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence
   of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to
   achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing
   detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems
   (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In
   addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium
   and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can
   both reduce energy consumption by up to 50\% compared with the existing
   All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10\% to
   15\% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are used to control chemical processes, and
   can be found in manufacturing, civil infrastructure, energy industry,
   transportation and in many more places. There is one common
   characteristic in these areas, their operation is critical as a
   malfunction can potential be life-threatening. In the past, an attack
   against the cyber part of the systems can lead to physical consequences.
   The first well known attack against a CPS was Stuxnet in 2010. It is
   challenging to develop countermeasures in this field without endangering
   the normal operation of the underlying system. In our research, our goal
   was to detect attacks without interfering with the cyber physical
   systems in any way. This can be realized by an anomaly detection system
   using passive network monitoring. Our approach is based on analysing the
   state of the physical process by interpreting the communication between
   the control system and the supervisory system. This state can be
   compared to a model based prediction of the system, which can serve as a
   solid base for intrusion detection. In order to realize our intrusion
   detection system, a testbed was built based on widely used Siemens PLCs.
   Our implementation consists of three main parts. The first task is to
   understand the network communication in order to gain information about
   the controlled process. This was realized by analysing and deeply
   understanding the publicly undocumented Siemens management protocol. The
   resulting protocol parser was integrated into the widely-used Bro
   network security monitoring framework. Gathering information about the
   process state for a prolonged time creates time series. With these time
   series, as the second step, statistical models of the physical process
   can be built to predict future states. As the final step, the new states
   of the physical process can be compared with the predicted states.
   Significant differences can be considered as an indicator of compromise.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems are critical to the infrastructure of a country.
   They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of
   off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on
   World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated
   their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network
   security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead
   to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the
   departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to
   build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time
   to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning
   intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the
   physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate
   of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment
   facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits
   a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model
   can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze a behavior-rule specification-based technique for
   intrusion detection of medical devices embedded in a medical cyber
   physical system (MCPS) in which the patient's safety is of the utmost

   state machine, so that a device that is being monitored for its behavior
   can easily be checked against the transformed state machine for
   deviation from its behavior specification. Using vital sign monitor
   medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion
   detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high
   detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden
   attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications. Moreover,
   through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our behavior-rule
   specification-based IDS technique outperforms two existing anomaly-based
   techniques for detecting abnormal patient behaviors in pervasive

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical
   processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
   physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
   affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the
   eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the
   President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will
   be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial
   control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random
   failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their
   growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect
   for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion
   detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any
   harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined
   universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism
   remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss
   how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in
   this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to
   define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the
   intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the
   layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some
   significant research problems are identified for enlightening the
   subsequent studies.}},

   gaps and propose research directions in CPS intrusion detection
   research, we survey the literature of this area. Our approach is to
   classify modern CPS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques based on
   two design dimensions: detection technique and audit material. We
   summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension's options. We also
   summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the
   literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of IDS techniques as
   they apply to CPSs. Finally, we identify gaps in CPS IDS research and

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of technology used in operation, monitoring, and
   control introduces several threats against power system. Cyber-physical
   power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of
   attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and
   attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers
   require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for
   simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such
   a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction
   to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the
   development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems.
   The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital
   simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a
   MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a
   platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system
   attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers.
   Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are
   implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system
   {[}11]. Fault, contingency and cyber-attack scenarios have been
   developed for both power systems. Selected relevant simulation results
   are presented.}},

   detection techniques, namely, positional discontinuity and

   CPS. We utilize the hierarchical model developed to analyze the
   performance characteristics of these two techniques and identify optimal
   design settings under which the reliability of the CPS may be maximized.
   The analysis reveals design tradeoffs in security assurance and energy
