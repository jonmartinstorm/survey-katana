Abstract = {{Specific intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are needed to secure modern
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems due to their
   architecture, stringent real-time requirements, network traffic features
   and specific application layer protocols. This article aims to
   contribute to assess the state-of-the-art, identify the open issues and
   provide an insight for future study areas. To achieve these objectives,
   we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion
   detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS
   solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that
   encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation
   tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is
   focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the
   applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet
   environment. Based on that, we provide a brief description and
   evaluation of 26 selected research papers, published in the period 2015
   \& x2013;2019. Results of our analysis indicate considerable progress
   regarding the development of machine learning-based detection methods,
   implementation platforms, and to some extent, sophisticated testbeds. We
   also identify research gaps and conclude the analysis with a list of the
   most important directions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection and prevention system detects malicious activities
   that occur in the real-time SCADA systems. This system has a problem
   without a profound solution. The challenge of the existing intrusion
   detection is accuracy in the process of detecting the anomalies. In
   SCADA, wind turbine data are modified by the intruders and forged
   details are given to the server. To overcome this, the biased intrusion
   detection system is used for detecting the intrusion with encrypted
   date, time, and file location with less false-positive and
   false-negative rates and thereby preventing the SCADA system from
   further intrusion. It is done in three phases. First, Modified Grey Wolf
   Optimization (MGWO) is used to extract the features needed for
   classification and to find the best weight. Second, Entropy-based
   Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) is used to extort the features and
   detect the intruded data with its intruded time, file location, and
   date. Finally, the data are encrypted using the Hybrid Elliptical Curve
   Cryptography (HECC) to prevent further attack. Experimental results show
   better accuracy in both detection as well as prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are widely
   deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs) such as
   energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and
   computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have
   become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices
   and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network
   attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network
   protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network
   intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both
   conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of
   relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or
   flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and
   identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we
   design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack
   instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network
   models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using
   realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed
   deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion
   detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and
   providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.}},

Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal
   networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed
   and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems
   (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous
   years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in
   the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system
   (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against
   ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and
   critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks
   have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries.
   The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to
   deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is
   signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end,
   we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly
   detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model
   that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of
   communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups.
   First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale
   the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to
   improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited
   nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using
   the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system
   for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally,
   to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection
   with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly
   detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset
   generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed
   approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate
   of 97\%.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-attacks against Critical
   Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose,
   designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a
   significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks.
   Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine
   learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks.
   Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge,
   ``Curse of dimensionality{''}. This scenario accentuates the necessity
   of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it
   identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features
   without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel
   filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of
   informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based
   Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were
   carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of
   RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall,

Abstract = {{The increased complexity and interconnectivity of SCADA infrastructure
   in the power system have exposed it to the multitude of vulnerabilities.
   There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion
   detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control
   system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the
   application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in
   detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have
   applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later,
   compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in
   the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA
   security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the
   malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network
   traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based
   protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate
   the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack
   which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack
   on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the
   attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental
   results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks
   within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.}},

   several critical infrastructures, they have connected to the internet.
   Consequently, SCADA systems face different sophisticated types of cyber
   adversaries. This paper suggests a Probability Risk Identification based
   Intrusion Detection System (PRI-IDS) technique based on analysing
   network traffic of Modbus TCP/IP for identifying replay attacks. It is
   acknowledged that Modbus TCP is usually vulnerable due to its
   unauthenticated and unencrypted nature. Our technique is evaluated using
   a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a custom
   SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is
   exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an
   attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave. The
   experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique can
   effectively and efficiently recognise replay attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Intentional attacks(1) that cause country wide blackouts, gas and water
   systems malfunction are actions that can be carried out by a nation to
   impact on another nation in a mean of war. Supervisory control and data

   utilities companies were designed with no security in mind causing the
   systems that a nation relies on to fall vulnerable to exploitation.
   Since SCADA networks are static in nature with pre-defined signatures of
   network traffic, we propose to design an anomaly-based intrusion
   detection system to detect abnormality in SCADA network traffic and
   protocols. We gather normal SCADA network traffic via tapping on the
   network for 30 days and then attack the network using Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack, message spoofing attack and man-in-the middle attack. We
   then train a classifier with two classes, normal and abnormal and report
   the classifier accuracy in detecting abnormal SCADA network traffic.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used
   in many applications including power transmission and distribution for
   situational awareness and control. Identifying and detecting intrusions
   in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this
   purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the
   existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false
   positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date
   and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to
   overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo
   Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based
   Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main
   intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a
   SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network
   dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the
   clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the
   best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the
   intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA
   algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the
   proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall,
   accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have
   shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves
   improved performance to identify unknown or zero-day attacks. In this
   paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection
   in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we
   present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in
   SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for
   anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing
   redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset
   can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models
   were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at
   the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State
   University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our
   proposed model has a key effect in reducing the time and computational
   complexity and achieved improved accuracy and detection rate. The
   accuracy of our proposed model was measured as 99.5 \% for

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the
   absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of
   intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data
   using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
   The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial
   control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult
   task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital
   systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in
   order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious
   activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection,
   sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a

Abstract = {{Industrial Control and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
   networks control critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear
   facilities, and water supply systems. These systems are increasingly the
   target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with
   successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and
   injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced
   tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a
   number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we
   study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source
   intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS,
   Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats
   against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control
   protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the
   performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its
   performance in low performance hardware systems.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that
   allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In
   the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information
   bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units;
   however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as
   internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give
   more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible
   cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These
   attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a
   country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system
   for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on
   SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning
   techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control
   devices. A support vector of type ``Class One{''} machine and a test
   lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by
   the electric utility industry to monitor and control electric power
   generation, transmission and distribution are recognized today as
   critical components of the electric power delivery infrastructure. SCADA
   systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely
   distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection
   mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great
   importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This
   defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate,
   since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the
   intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated
   detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed
   in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system
   (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an
   intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the
   integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations
   based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they
   control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including
   electric power, oil \& gas and others. The protocols used in this domain
   were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much
   consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today
   have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks,
   leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the
   physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to
   improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are
   typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended
   with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is
   its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial
   support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on
   existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic
   rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple
   language grammar allows network engineers to describe system
   characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of
   the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with
   SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates
   network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS.
   An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system
   changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital
   component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in
   SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking
   mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when
   increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the
   system security, but few of them can effectively resist response
   injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper
   we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the
   periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical
   SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in
   SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing
   an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect
   response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the
   network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered
   simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection,
   especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed
   system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching
   severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is
   polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of our IDS mechanism.}},

   concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition
   (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming
   needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which
   are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some
   disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the
   intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an
   integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel ``What-if{''}
   module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal.
   This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the
   system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer
   and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually
   clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these
   work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the
   proposed `` What-if{''} module.}},

Abstract = {{Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems.
   Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence
   the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is
   impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks.
   A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in
   the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack
   scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power
   systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed
   consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal
   Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI)
   etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial
   communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3.The proposed
   testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting
   potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to
   send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from
   the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in
   reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher
   security measures.}},

   the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of

Abstract = {{The massive use of information and communication technologies in
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways
   for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying
   on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the
   heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for
   traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has
   become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very
   severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious
   intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and
   firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for
   intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification
   algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated:
   1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel
   principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is
   examined in detail with the study of l(p)-norms in radial basis function
   (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the
   bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data
   with several types of cyberattacks.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are
   designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with
   other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last
   years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to
   attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its
   normal operation.
   In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of
   detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support
   Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering.
   The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the
   proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from
   possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters sigma and v,
   making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA
   systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off
   line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of
   an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI

Abstract = {{Cyber threats in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems have the potential to render physical damage and jeopardize
   power system operation, safety and stability. SCADA systems were
   originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber
   threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion
   detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an
   emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
   method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC
   60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol

   presented that is designed specifically for the IEC 60870-5-104

Abstract = {{SCADA systems are broadly employed in supervising and controlling
   industrial areas comprising manufacturing industries, traffic control,
   power plants, integrated water management systems (distribution,
   treatment and sewage).
   The security of SCADA systems represents a significant subject on
   account of the critical function that these systems perform in offering
   vital utility services. In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access
   to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason
   that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce
   interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the
   network control plane and /or the data plane.
   Critical infrastructures, requiring uninterrupted operation,
   maintenance, and protection, have need of robust and secured control
   SCADA systems. The paper intends to depicts the critical architectural
   constituents of these systems, detect vulnerabilities and possible
   threats, and illustrate protection techniques that may be set up in
   order to reduce attacks involving situation awareness solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced false data injection attack in targeted malware intrusion is
   becoming an emerging severe threat to the Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) system. Several intrusion detection schemes have
   been proposed previously {[}1, 2]. However, designing an effective
   real-time detection system for a resource-constraint device is still an
   open problem for the research community. In this paper, we propose a new
   relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection
   attacks at the SCADA system, even when injected data may seemly fall
   within a valid/normal range. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we
   design a novel detection model, alternation vectors with state relation
   graph. Furthermore, we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the
   injection point(s), i.e., the attack origin, in the system. We evaluate
   SRID with a real-world power plant simulator. The experiment results
   show that SRID can detect various false data injection attacks with a
   low false positive rate at 0.0125\%. Meanwhile, SRID can dramatically
   reduce the search space of attack origins and accurately locate most of
   attack origins.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of
   detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) system. Malicious data in a SCADA system disrupt its
   correct functioning and tamper with its normal operation. OCSVM
   (One-Class Support Vector Machine) is an intrusion detection mechanism
   that does not need any labeled data for training or any information
   about the kind of anomaly is expecting for the detection process. This
   feature makes it ideal for processing SCADA environment data and
   automate SCADA performance monitoring. The OCSVM module developed is
   trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system
   real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
   system developed under CockpitCI project and communicates with the other
   parts of the system by the exchange of IDMEF (Intrusion Detection
   Message Exchange Format) messages that carry information about the
   source of the incident, the time and a classification of the alarm.}},

Abstract = {{The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for
   communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable
   logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion
   detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The
   approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from
   a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can
   be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An
   algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA
   associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages.
   The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into
   Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This
   approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a
   message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a
   message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection
   approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high
   sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect
   matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven
   PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111 h of operation.
   Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real
   anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the
   HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured
   incorrectly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient
   part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as
   electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution,
   and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their
   connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e. g.
   TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these
   systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in
   these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking
   authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are
   potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with
   unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because
   labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly
   and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms
   suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that
   can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to
   improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework
   demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion
   detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and

   greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy

   vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little

   System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes
   signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems.
   The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known
   suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is
   proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally,
   proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are

Abstract = {{Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and
   deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small
   amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic
   controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data
   within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system
   failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion
   Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational
   behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm
   filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are
   required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity
   when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks
   are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and
   simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with
   and without the TFIDS.}},

   detection approach suitable for implementation across multiple resource
   constrained SCADA field devices in the smart grid. The predictable and
   regular nature of the SCADA communication patterns is exploited to
   detect intrusions in the field devices. The novel approach is
   anomaly-based, uses the Bloom filter data structure for memory
   efficiency and incorporates the physical state of the power system for
   greater robustness. The proposed method is tested using MODBUS protocol
   used for communication between a SCADA server and field devices in a
   SCADA system.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel Intrusion Detection System able to detect complex
   attacks to SCADA systems. By complex attack, we mean a set of commands
   (carried in Modbus packets) that, while licit when considered in
   isolation on a single-packet basis, interfere with the correct behavior
   of the system. The proposed IDS detects such attacks thanks to an
   internal representation of the controlled SCADA system and a
   corresponding rule language, powerful enough to express the system's
   critical states. Furthermore, we detail the implementation and provide
   experimental comparative results.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a critical
   part of large industrial facilities, such as water distribution
   infrastructures. With the goal of reducing costs and increasing
   efficiency, these systems are becoming increasingly interconnected.
   However, tins has also exposed them to a wide range of network security
   problems. Our research focus on the development of a novel flow-based
   intrusion detection system. Based on the assumption that SCADA networks
   are well-behaved, we believe that it is possible to model the normal
   traffic by establishing relations between network flows. To improve
   accuracy and provide more information on the anomalous traffic, we will
   also research methods to derive a flow-based model for anomalous flows.}},

Abstract = {{Current Intrusion Detection System (IDS) technology is not suited to be
   widely deployed inside a Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) environment. Anomaly- and signature-based IDS technologies have
   developed methods to cover information technology-based networks
   activity and protocols effectively. However, these IDS technologies do
   not include the fine protocol granularity required to ensure network
   security inside an environment with weak protocols lacking
   authentication and encryption. By implementing a more specific and more
   intelligent packet inspection mechanism, tailored traffic flow analysis,
   and unique packet tampering detection, IDS technology developed
   specifically for SCADA environments can be deployed with confidence in
   detecting malicious activity.}},
