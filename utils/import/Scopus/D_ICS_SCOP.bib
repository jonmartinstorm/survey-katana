abstract={Due to the complexity of industrial control systems and the diversity of protocols in networks, it is difficult to build intrusion detection models based on network characteristics and physical modeling. In order to build a better flow model without additional knowledge, we propose an intrusion detection method based on the content of network packets. The construction of the model is based on the idea of ZOE method. The similarity between flows is calculated through the sequential coverage algorithm, the normal flow model is established by multi-layered clustering algorithm, and the Count-Mean-Min Sketch is used to store and count the flow model. By comparing the unknown flow with the constructed normal flow model, we achieve the intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS). The overall experimental results on 4 ICS datasets show that the improved method can effectively improve the detection rate and reduce the false-positive rate. The detection rate reached 96.7% on average, and the false-positive rate reached 0.7% on average. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The recycling of used integrated circuits (ICs) has raised serious problems in ensuring the integrity of today's globalized semiconductor supply chain. This poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure due to potentially shorter lifetime, lower reliability, and poorer performance from these counterfeit new chips. Recently, we have proposed a highly effective approach for detecting such chips by exploiting the power-up state of on-chip SRAMs. Due to the symmetry of the memory array layout, an equal number of cells power-up to the 0 and 1 logic states in a new unused SRAM; this ratio gets skewed in time due to uneven NBTI aging from normal usage in the field. Although this solution is very effective in detecting recycled ICs, its applicability is somewhat limited as a large number older designs do not have large on-chip memories. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach based on the initial power-up state of scan flip-flops, which are present in virtually every digital circuit. Since the flip-flops, unlike SRAM cells, are generally not perfectly symmetrical in layout, an equal number of scan cells will not power-up to 0 or 1 logic states in most designs. Consequently, a stable time zero reference of 50% logic 0s and 1s cannot be used for determining the subsequent usage of a chip. To overcome this key limitation, we propose a novel solution in this paper that reliably identifies used ICs from testing the part alone, without the need for any additional reference data or even the netlist of the circuit. Through scan testing of the IC, we first identify a significant number of asymmetrically stressed flip-flops in the design, divided into two groups. One group of flip-flops is selected such that it mostly experiences the 1 logic state during functional operation, while the other group mostly experiences the 0 state. The resulting differential stress during operation causes growing disparity over time in the number of 0s (and 1s) observed in these two groups at power-up. When new and unaged, these two groups behave similarly, with similar percentage of 1s (or 0s). However, over time the differential stress makes these counts diverge. We show that this changing count can be a measure of operational aging. Our simulation results show that it is possible to reliably detect used ICs after as little as three months of operation. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and validation can be carried out efficiently. Existing acceleration techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about 105 × acceleration) under the 150 °C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem that the existing anomaly detection algorithms in industrial control systems are insufficient in semantic attacks, an anomaly detection algorithm based on hybrid Markov tree model is proposed. The periodic characteristics of industrial control system is utilized to construct the system normal behavioral model at runtime --- mixed-order Markov tree. The model includes four kinds of information: legal state events, legal state transition, normal probability distribution and normal transition time interval. Based on the dynamic adaptive method, the relation between state events are enhanced and the time interval information is added to realize the detection for more complex semantic attacks. When modeling, a pruning strategy is designed to remove low frequency events, low transition events and redundant nodes in the model. When the detected behavior makes the deviation of the above four kinds of information of the model exceed the threshold, the system detects the anomaly. Finally, a simplified sewage treatment system based on OMNeT++ network simulation environment is constructed to verify the function of the proposed algorithm, and a data set of a real physical testbed is used to verify the detection accuracy of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate the noise of human interaction and normal diagnosis, and has high detection rate for complex semantic attacks and can also identify traditional non-semantic attacks.

abstract={Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about 250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by using the proposed methodology. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019},

abstract={3D multicore systems with stacked DRAM are capable of boosting system performance significantly, but accompanied with the key problem of the effect of heat density and heat dissipation on circuit reliability. Aiming to study the TDDB (Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown) effect in DRAM of 3D-ICs, we adopt a physical-based SPICE model and analyze the statistical TDDB degradation induced by the gate leakage current in peripheral circuits of DRAM. Meanwhile, a TDDB detection design is proposed based on the 45nm process, which is suitable for large scale integration of the memory circuit. And the operation of the detection circuit is analyzed based on the BTI (Bias Temperature Instability) effect. Experimental results show that sense amplifiers are more susceptible to time dependent dielectric breakdown than word-line drivers in DRAM. The proposed TDDB detection design can completely meet the maximum fault coverage rate with good robustness to BTI, and it will send out an alarm signal when TDDB happens in the sense amplifier. © 2019, The Editorial Board of Journal of Xidian University.

abstract={Most of prior hardware Trojan detection approaches require golden chips for references. A classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique has been proposed in the authors' previous work. However, the algorithm in that work is trained by simulated ICs without considering a shift between the simulation and silicon fabrication. In this study, a co-training based hardware Trojan detection method by exploiting inaccurate simulation models and unlabeled fabricated ICs is proposed to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, which eliminates the need of golden chips. Two classification algorithms are trained using simulated ICs. These two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabelled ICs during test-time, and thus can label some of these ICs for the further training of the other algorithm. Moreover, a statistical examination is used to choose ICs labelling for the other algorithm. A statistical confidence interval based technique is also used to combine the hypotheses of the two classification algorithms. Furthermore, the partial least squares method is used to preprocess the raw data of ICs for feature selection. Both EDA experiment results and field programmable gate array (FPGA) experiment results show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy and recall. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={To reduce the excessive power consumption and eliminate the battery voltage imbalance caused in conventional method, a novel broken line detection scheme for Li-ion battery protection integrated circuits (ICs) is presented in this study. The main part of the proposed circuit consists of pull-up, pull-down current source, source-driven MOS, a control switch and a bias current source. A narrow pulse control signal is adopted to trigger broken line detection periodically so as to suppress the detection current consumption, while the disadvantage of battery voltage imbalance is overcome. The proposed circuit has been implemented in a seven cells Li-ion battery protection IC with 0.18 µm 45 V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process successfully. The experimental results confirm that the chip can reliably detect the disconnections of Li-ion batteries and take protective measures in a wide cell voltage range from 2.2 to 4.2 V. Furthermore, based on the derivation in this study, the proposed technique can significantly reduce the detection current consumption of each cell, which is well beneficial for low power consumption and battery voltage balance. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time. © 2018 IEEE.},

Existing techniques to detect counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) are limited by relatively high cost, lengthy inspection time, destructive nature, and restriction to a pre-packaging environment. We propose a novel method of counterfeit IC detection which takes advantage of design-specific electromagnetic (EM) fingerprints generated by simulating on-chip clock distribution networks. Through exploitation of the chip's physical characteristics, our technique can help detect foundry of origin. We validate our approach on 8051 microcontrollers from three different vendors and utilize principal component analysis to distinguish the acquisitions by vendor.

Traditional security tools based on a signature approach are not always able to detect a new attack, the signature of which has not yet been described. In particular, this occurs during targeted attacks on industrial facilities. Cyber attacks can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and process equipment under its control. Therefore, to detect attacks, it is advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine learning (decision tree algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector machine) and neural networks.

Following this, the hypervisor is employed to ascertain plausible trust relationships among the VMs by considering personal sources that can be trusted along with utilizing empirical Bayesian inference (EBI) for the purpose of combining the VMs. With a restricted budget of resources for the maximized detection of attacks, an optimal detection load distribution strategy by improved cuckoo search (ICS) over VMs can be used, which thus provides the intended solution to the hypervisor. The ICS algorithm directs a hypervisor so as to assert among the VMs the optimal load distribution, taking into consideration real time, which causes maximization of the DDoS attacks and detection of transmission control protocol (TCP) flood attacks.

abstract={The malicious codes and attacks against ICS today are becoming more advanced and intelligent. The security risk for ICS is increasing, and it’s becoming more important to secure the cyber safety of ICS from these security threats. Recent ICS not only uses serial communication protocol, but also an Ethernet-based control communication protocol. Malicious codes attacking ICS attempts to imitate the corresponding control protocol to insert malware into the payload for communication, or imitates normal control packets for malicious control or disabling of control devices. Also, multiple presentations exist on the possible scenarios of various cyber attack targeting. However, current IDS/IPS for ICS functions with technology to detect attacks based on a blacklist, and thus cannot detect attacks exhibiting new techniques. In order to solve these problems, there have been recent studies on white list based attack detection technology for practical application on ICS. However, current studies on white list based detection technology utilizes a white list based on IP address, service port number information, etc., and thus cannot be utilized to detect attacks exhibiting a replay pattern or in which only data value is changed inside a normal command. This study suggests a technology that can detect attacks exhibiting a replay pattern against ICS, using white list based detection and machine learning to educate control traffic and apply the results to actual detection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively used in modern industries combined with the conventional industrial control system (ICS) network through the industrial cloud to make the production data easily available to the corporate business management and easier control for highly profitable production systems. The different devices within the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection of ICS. Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure. Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of deep learning to design our detection model. Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed detection models is that the models are adaptive where training procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks. Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes, learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms and obtain similar performances with earlier semi-supervised work (Huda et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Threats that cause malicious function such as information leakage and denial of service by adding hardware trojan (HT) to a device constructed using inexpensive elements at component level after shipment have been reported. The detection method after shipment, which is different from HT detection inside IC is required because of the easiness adding component-level HT to products. The testing method to detect modification on board will achieve the detection of component-level HT. In this brief, we focus on the HT implemented in the wiring connected to integrated circuits. Since the component connection constantly affects the impedance of the wiring, we propose a detection method for such HT implemented outside the IC by measuring the change in the impedance of the wiring. For the detection of malicious modification after shipment it is necessary to excite a pulse signal from the IC that achieves high security, such as a secure microcomputer, and observe the signal reflected inside the secure IC by the discontinuous portion of the impedance on the board. If the reflected signal is different from the shipping test, it can be judged that HT is mounted. We adopted time domain reflectometry (TDR) to realize the above method, and we demonstrate experimental result of component-level HT detection using TDR with measuring instrument and TDR from secure IC. As a result, a significant change in the amplitude due to the impedance change was obtained from the reflected wave measured inside the IC with and without the MOSFET used as the HT using this method. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans. Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips. First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs. During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy (92%~97%) and recall (88%~95%). © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The electronic industry has been experiencing a growing counterfeit market, resulting in electronic supply chains in other industries to be prone to counterfeit parts as well. Over the past few years, several methods have been developed for evaluating the reliability of an IC and distinguishing them as counterfeit or authentic. Trained experts offer services for evaluating an IC based on destructive or non-destructive methods. However, defect detection and recognition are mostly dependent on human decision, and therefore are vulnerable to error. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect and identify die-face delamination on an IC die. Die-face delamination is a predominant internal defect in recycled ICs but can be easily missed during defect detection. Here, we have acquired the 3D image of an IC non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography and applied image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms on the 3D image to detect die-face delamination in the forms of thermally induced cracks and damaged surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs) has become an increasingly vital concern for the security of commercial and mission-critical systems. Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked, out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID, which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared to traditional on-chip sensors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem. In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8%, 83.3%, 67.9%, and 25.4% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively, for a typical die at 25 °C, compared to baseline frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is suitable for wide-operating-range applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous growth of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) poses a serious threat to our critical infrastructures due to their inferior quality and has become one of the major concerns to the government and the industry. Detection of these ICs is challenging especially when they have been used for a short period of time, as the process variations (especially in lower technology nodes) could outpace the degradation caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a robust, accurate, and low-cost solution for efficient detection of recycled ICs, even if they have been used for a very short period of time. The proposed solution utilizes a ring oscillator (RO), and a nonvolatile memory. It stores the RO frequency, conditions (e.g., supply voltage, temperature, and duration) for the frequency measurement, and a digital signature. The simulation and silicon results demonstrate that we can effectively detect recycled ICs used as low as one day. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present an unconventional anti ICS-malware approach. We leverage a factor that appears to be overlooked as of this writing, namely that ICS malware often infect machines which do not run any functions related to industrial process control. These may be, for example, business machines in the enterprise networks of power utility companies, or even random machines on the Internet. Because ICS environments use special-purpose communication protocols, it is highly unlikely that any application code on those machines will send or receive network traffic through an ICS communication protocol. On the other hand, ICS malware discover their targets via searches that initiate ICS communication protocol traffic. Our approach uses a kernel filter driver to analyze the network traffic that flows through a real NIC. The kernel filter driver works with a module that uses in-kernel ICS protocol signatures to recognize ICS protocol traffic embedded within the network traffic in question. Our approach can detect 0-day malware on machines that are unrelated to industrial process control, without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data. We performed extensive testing against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns, as well as safety and efficiency tests, and thus discuss the findings in the paper. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects in today's and future sub-10nm ICs, one critical issue is how to create stressing conditions so that the chip will fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM signoff and validation can be carried out efficiently. In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration techniques for practical VLSI chips. We will first review the recently proposed three-phase physics-based EM models and discuss the important factors contributing to the EM aging process. Then we propose a new formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing temperature. On average, 10% increase in temperature yields about 10X wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM, and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10 years down to a few hours (about 105 acceleration) under the 150°C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: To analyze the possibility of using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to evaluate NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and to detect the changes in ADCC activity among patients with chronic HIV and/or HCV infection. Methods: Flow cytometry was performed to determine the percentages of NK cells and the expression of NK cell receptors. ImageStreamX MarkⅡ system was used to identify the expression of CD3, CD56, CD16 and CD32 on CD56brightNK and CD56dimNK subsets. Degranulation process and cytokine production in NK cells were detected using an antigen-antibody complex model of P815/Ab in combination with ICS. Differences in NK cell-mediated ADCC were evaluated among patients infected with HIV and/or HIV and healthy subjects by flow cytometry. Results: The percentages of CD107a+ and IFN-γ+ NK cells were positively correlated with the decrease of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD16. ICS assay revealed a positive correlation between the secretion of CD107a and IFN-γ by NK cells. CD16 was highly expressed in CD56dimNK cells. The ADCC mediated by CD56dimNK cells was stronger than that mediated by CD56brightNK cells. The rate of target cell lysis detected by rapid fluorescence assay was positively correlated with the percentage of CD107a+ /IFN-γ+ NK cells measured by ICS. NK cell-mediated ADCC was suppressed in patients with chronic HIV and/or HCV infection. Conclusion: This study suggests that ICS assay could be used to evaluate NK cell-mediated ADCC. It also reveals that NK cell-mediated ADCC is suppressed in patients with chronic HIV and/or HCV infection. Copyright © 2018 by the Chinese Medical Association.},

abstract={A wideband microwave method is described as a means for rapid detection of slight dissimilarities and aging effects in integrated circuits (ICs). The method is based on measuring the complex reflection coefficient of an IC when illuminated with an open-ended rectangular waveguide probe, at K-band (18-26.5 GHz) and Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz) microwave frequencies. The spatially integrated reflected electromagnetic signature of a given IC is a function of its internal material properties, geometry and metallic deposition of circuit element, and wire bonds. Consequently, dissimilar (including counterfeit) and aged ICs exhibit markedly different reflection properties than their reference and new (nonaged) counterparts. In addition to measuring spatially integrated complex reflection coefficient (over the waveguide aperture), it is also integrated over the operating frequency band (spectrally integrated), resulting in significant increase in the robustness of the approach. Root-mean-squared-error, defined as the average Euclidean distance between two reflection coefficient vectors, is used to associate a quantitative metric to the complex reflection coefficient difference between two dissimilar ICs. Measurement results on several sets of ICs having the same package (DIP-14) and different functionalities, similar functionalities with slight differences in specifications, and aged ICs are presented. The results clearly indicate the capability of this method to differentiate among ICs having slight differences in packaging material properties and/or electronic circuitry. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have posed a major security and safety threat on commercial and mission-critical systems. In this paper, we propose to develop a comprehensive counterfeit ICs detection and prevention strategy, consisting of an innovative multi-functional on-chip sensor and a related post-fabrication authentication methodology. We target at many counterfeit ICs including the recycled/remarked/out-of-spec ICs, as well as cloned and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of antifuse memory and aging sensors to reduce reference circuit related area overhead of those sensor circuits. Second, the new sensor combines both the ring-oscillator based aging sensor with recently proposed electromigration(EM)-based aging sensor so that it can be effective for estimation of both short and long period time of chip usage. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed multi-functional sensor against existing on-chip sensors in terms of functionality, detection coverage and usage time estimation range and accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA) is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of SVM parameters selection. © 2017 IEEE.},

With their impact carefully hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process variations, these hardware Trojans cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and do not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB TX. Moreover, through physical measurements and MATLAB simulations, we show that the attack facilitated by these hardware Trojans is robust to test equipment and communication channel noise. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of a popular hardware Trojan detection method, namely, statistical side-channel fingerprinting via trained one-class classifiers, in detecting the hardware Trojans introduced in our fabricated IC population. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS, SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks at a rate of 99%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of 81-93%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating few attack scenarios generating false negatives. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Defects in through-silicon vias (TSVs) due to fabrication steps decrease the yield and reliability of 3-D stacked integrated circuits, and hence these defects need to be detected early to reduce chip's DPM. In this paper, a new fault detection and repair method for TSVs in 3D-ICs is proposed. The contribution of the method is to detect stuck-at-faults and delay-based fault in TSV by a scan-based built-in self-test (BIST) architecture. This test architecture supports both pre-bond and post-bond TSV testing. By constructing RC model and analyzing the delay characteristics of TSV, the variation of TSV-to-substrate resistance caused by TSV defects can be mapped to the change of path delay so that the related fault can be detected. Based on the test architecture, we propose a TSV redundancy structure to repair circuit after failed TSVs are detected. Results of fault detection effectiveness are presented through ModelSim simulations using realistic models under 65 nm CMOS technology. And redundancy design leads to 99.9846% recovery rate for TSVs with only 0.2% redundancy rate of TSVs. © 2015 IEEE.},

ICS devices must be protected in a holistic and efficient manner; especially when these are supporting critical infrastructure. Taking this issue into account, cyber-security research is recently being focused on providing early detection and warning mechanisms for ICSs. In this paper we present a novel honeypot capable of detecting multi-stage attacks targeting ICS networks. Upon detecting a multi-stage attack, our honeypot can generate signatures so that misuse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can subsequently thwart attacks of the same type. Our experimental results indicate that our honeypot and the signatures it generates provide good detection accuracy and that the Bro IDS can successfully use the signatures to prevent future attacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The counterfeiting and recycled integrated circuits (ICs) has become a major security threat for commercial and military systems. In addition to the huge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety threats on those systems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight on-chip aging sensor, which is based on the electromigration (EM)-induced aging effects for fast detection and prevention of recycled ICs. Our new EM-based aging sensor exploits the natural aging/failure mechanism of interconnect wires to time the aging of the chip. Compared with existing aging sensor, the new aging sensor can provide more accurate prediction of the chip usage time at smaller area footprints due to its simple structure. The new sensor is based on a newly proposed physics-based stress evolution model of EM effects for accurate prediction of the EM failure. As a result, we can design the interconnect wire structures based on copper interconnect technology so that the resulting wires will have detectable EM failure at a specific time with sufficient accuracy. In order to mitigate the problem of the inherent variations in the metal grain sizes and assess its impacts on the nucleation time of metal wires, a number of parallel properly structured wires are used in the sensor. The parameters of the wires are optimized using the new EM model. Our statistical and variational analysis shows that the proposed aging sensor can accurately predict the targeted failure times in the presence of both inherent uncertainties. Our study also shows that more parallel wires will lead to more accurate statistical predictions at costs of more areas. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce a Concurrent Hardware Trojan Detection (CHTD) methodology for wireless cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs), based on continuous extraction of a side-channel fingerprint and evaluation by a trained on-chip neural classifier. While similar statistical side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically, during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is, therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed CHTD methodology effectively identifies hardware Trojans when they are active, while not incurring any false positives when they are absent or dormant. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Malicious tampering of the internal circuits of ICs can lead to detrimental results. Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection. It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100% coverage with low false positive rates. © 2015 EDAA.},

abstract={Background: Hemolysis is the main cause of non-quality samples in clinical laboratories, producing the highest percentage of rejections in the external assurance programs of preanalytical quality. The objective was to: 1) study the agreement between the detection methods and quantification of hemolysis; 2) establish comparable hemolysis interference limits for a series of tests and analytical methods; and 3) study the preanalytical variables which most influence hemolysis production.
Methods: Different hemoglobin concentration standards were prepared using the reference method. Agreement was studied between automated methods [hemolytic indexes (HI)] and reference method, as well as the interference according to hemolysis degree in various biochemical tests was measured. Preanalytical variables which could influence hemolysis production were studied: type of extraction, type of tubes, transport time, temperature and centrifugation conditions.
Results: Good agreement was obtained between hemoglobin concentrations measured using the reference method and HI, for the most of studied analyzers, particularly those giving quantitative HI. The hemolysis interference cut-off points obtained for the majority of tests studied (except LDH, K) are dependent on the method/analyzer utilized. Furthermore, discrepancies have been observed between interference limits recommended by the manufacturer. The preanalytical variables which produce a lower percentage of hemolysis rejections were: centrifugation at the extraction site, the use of lower volume tubes and a transport time under 15 min at room temperature.
Conclusions: The setting of interference limits (cut-off) for each used test/method, and the study of preanalytical variability will assist to the results harmonization for this quality indicator.},

With identical functionality and packaging, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

One way to achieve this is by means of connecting probes to wires, so that the content of internal buses and registers can be revealed. Protection against this type of attacks exists, but usually is bulky and expensive, e.g. the shielding of secured areas. This paper presents a novel in-circuit countermeasure that is cheap and can easily be integrated in existing designs to detect probing attempts. It is based on a ring oscillator that operates over coupled lines in a differential mode. When the loading of one of the lines is unbalanced over a tolerance margin, an impulse is generated and integrated over time. If the integration surpasses a given threshold an alarm signal is activated. Simulations show the stability of the detector over a range of temperature and supply voltage variations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Fault detection and diagnosis of safety and mission-critical embedded systems is a constant concern of the aerospace community. There exists a number of fault detection and diagnosis techniques, which are usually based on generating complicated models of the system, or increasing its redundancy. The present paper shows a new approach, based on hash libraries, which allows for fault detection and diagnosis at circuit level, without previous modeling of the system or adding redundancy. Additionally, the proposed technique can be used to detect faults in real-time in a final application, where no comparison with a golden chip is available. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Interconnect imperfections have become an important issue in modern nanometer technologies. Some of them cause Small Delay Defects (SDDs) which are difficult to detect. Those SDDs not detected during testing may pose a reliability problem. Furthermore, nanometer issues (e.g. process variations, spatial correlations) represent important challenges for traditional delay test methods. In this paper, a methodology to compute the Detection Probability (DP) of resistive open and bridge defects using a statistical timing framework that takes into account process variations and other nanometer issues is proposed. The DP gives the sensitivity of the circuit performance to a given resistance range of the defect. The efficiency issue when analyzing large circuits is alleviated using stratified sampling techniques to reduce the space of possible analyzed defect locations This methodology is applied to some ISCAS benchmark circuits. The obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Measures can be taken for those circuits presenting non-acceptable DP in order to improve the test quality. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a two-step non-scan design-for-test methodology that can ease detection of an embedded Trojan and simultaneously partially obfuscates a design against Trojan implantations. In the first step, we use Q̄ signals of flip-flops in a circuit to increase the number of reachable states. In the second step, we partition these flip-flops into different groups enhancing the state-space variation. Creation of these new reachable states helps to trigger and propagate the Trojan effect more easily. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show that this method can effectively uncover Trojans which are otherwise very difficult to detect in the normal functional mode. In addition, partitioning the flip-flops of the circuit into different groups and selecting the output (Q or Q̄) based on input controlled ENABLE signals conceal its actual functionality beyond simple recognition thereby making it difficult for the adversary to implant Trojans. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A testing structure was developed to more effectively detect the poly stringer defects in contemporary CMOS ICs. This structure is much more sensitive to poly stringer defects and is closer to the real product layout than the currently widely used structure using an active dummy underneath a poly comb. Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 μm copper process line were used to compare the current design with the conventional testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width. This structure can be used to identify new designs for manufacturing rules for the active space. Thus, this method is very useful for IC foundries to detect poly stringers and to characterize the processing line capability and tune the process recipe to improve product yields. © 2010 Tsinghua University Press.},

abstract={Testing the genuineness of a manufactured chip is an important step in an IC product life cycle. This becomes more prominent with the outsourcing of the manufacturing process, since the manufacturer may tamper the internal circuit behavior using Trojan circuits in the original design. Traditional testing methods cannot detect these stealthy Trojans because the triggering scenario, which activates it, is unknown. Recently, approaches based on side-channel analysis have shown promising results in detecting Trojans. In this paper, we propose a novel test generation technique that aims at magnifying the disparity between side-channel signal waveforms of tampered and genuine circuits to indicate the possibility of internal tampering. Experimental results indicate that our approach could magnify the likelihood of Trojans 4 to 20 times more than existing side-channel analysis based approaches. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={There have been serious concerns recently about the security of microchips from hardware trojan horse insertion during manufacturing. This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics, communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to detect trojan effects. We also provide experimental results. © 2008 EDAA.},

abstract={Traditional testing is based on applying signals to circuit inputs and observing logic state of outputs. However, with the introduction of CMOS technology a new test technique emerged, that is based on applying signal inputs and observing standby electrical current. This technique is known as IDDQ testing. In most CMOS circuits, when all inputs are frozen in place and circuit transient activities settle down, the current drops by 3-5 orders of magnitude below normal levels. During testing, if there is a deviation from this behavior a defect is detected. While parametric test of electric current has always been popular (including in bipolar and NMOS technologies) to detect short between power supply lines, the promise of IDDQ test is that it will also allow detection of bridging between signal nets and transistor stuck-on faults in CMOS circuits. However, in reality, the resolution of the size of the defect is limited by the magnitude of stand-by current. Since normal process variation can cause shift in stand-by current by two orders of magnitude, choosing a single threshold for IDDQ defect detection is impractical. Many ideas have been proposed to overcame this problem, most of which are based on choosing an adaptive cut-off point for a wafer, or a lot. In this paper, we suggest a technique, that in concept, is akin to setting an individual cutoff point for a die. The concept has been validated based on actual data.},

Monitoring the integral of the supply current is specially used for real time, batch testing for mixed signal integrated circuits because additional computation and comparing the obtained current waveforms with the free fault current do not required. Two bit parallel comparison CMOS AD converter is adopted as the circuit under test. The integral of the supply current is only monitored during one clock period when the input stimulus is applied, determining whether the circuit is free fault.},

abstract={In this paper we have investigated a unified and simultaneous fault detection method for mixed-signal integrated circuits. The method is based on the analysis of the power-supply current through the circuit under test. The analysis has been done paying attention to the dynamic behaviour of the power-supply current, in order to avoid measurement problems related to the large amount of quiescent current drop across many analog blocks. The analysis of the dynamic power-supply current entails certain problems related to the complexity of the measurement process, especially those due to the high speed of the current transients. These problems have been addressed by considering a design for test procedure based on the use of built-in dynamic current sensors. The goal of the design for test methodology proposed is to represent the Iddt through the mixed-signal IC under test by a digital signature. The paper presents some advantages of this approach such as a good tolerance to crosstalk noise and the need for only a conventional digital tester on the complete mixed-signal IC for fault detection. The analysis is illustrated with some test results. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Dynamic effects in the detection of bridging faults in CMOS circuits are taken into account showing that a test vector designed to detect a bridging may be invalidated because of the increased propagation delay of the faulty signal. To overcome this problem, it is shown that a sequence of two test vectors &lt; T0, T1 &gt;, in which the second can detect a bridging fault as a steady error, can detect the fault independently of additional propagation delays if T0 initializes the faulty signal to a logic value different from the fault-free one produced by T1. This technique can be conveniently used both in test generation and fault simulation. In addition, it is shown how any fault simulator able to deal with FCMOS circuits can be modified to evaluate the impact of test invalidation on the fault coverage of bridging faults. For any test vector, this can be done by checking the state of the circuit produced by the previous test vector. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the effects induced on the electrical behavior of BiCMOS digital circuits by bridging faults, whose instrinsic resistance value is shown to have a strong impact on the static behavior of faulty gates and of their fan-out gates. The problem of fault detection is then addressed considering two different testing techniques (current monitoring and functional testing). Simulations of the electrical behavior of faulty BiCMOS circuits have enlightened the main differences with respect to the CMOS technology: the larger driving capability of BJTs with respect to MOSFETs makes the detection of bridging faults much more difficult in BiCMOS circuits when functional testing is considered, but more effective when current monitoring is used. © 1992 IEEE.},

abstract={An antigen-specific method has been developed for direct detection and quantitation of HBsAg-ICs. The method involves (1) precipitation of HBsAg-ICs with 3.5% PEG; (2) dissociation of the PEG precipitated ICs by treatment with NaSCN, NaI, KBr, low or high pH buffers, trypsin or papain; and (3) detection and titration of HBsAg and/or anti-HBs liberated from ICs. Treatment with 2 M and 3 M NaSCN, papain or trypsin liberates HBsAg, while following treatment with 3 M NaI free anti-HBs is detectable. Trypsin digestion (2 mg/ml, 30 min at 37°C) proved to be most effective for disrupting HBsAg-ICs formed at equivalence as well as in excess of antigen or antibody. After trypsin digestion of the sample RPHA, RIA and ELISA may be used as a third step. The method was developed and standardized by the use of artificial HBsAg-ICs. © 1980.},

abstract={Using the PEG-trypsinisation assay, HBsAG-CICs were detected in 70% of patients with acute hepatitis B, in 5% of the asymptomatic HBsAg carriers and, in addition, in each of the 2 cases of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In serial examinations, the complexed HBsAg levels in 77% of patients with acute hepatitis B decreased progressively in parallel with the free HBsAg levels, and persisted in the remaining 23%. In 19% of patients positive for HBsAg-CICs, the complexed HBsAg levels were higher than those of free HBsAG. No correlation was observed between results of PEG-trypsinisation and an anticomplementary assay. Artificial HBsAg-ICs in antigen excess were found to be poorly anticomplementary. C3 concentrations were normal or elevated in the majority (88%) of sera positive for HBsAg-CICs. These findings suggest that HBsAg-CICs in antigen excess are unlikely to be complement-activating. The method is useful for clinical investigation and for routine examination for HBsAg-CICs. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

The systems range from data acquisition to industrial control. The devices are being used in various circuit configurations to reduce substantially the effects of system noise. The circuits provide compensatory waveshaping and level detection. In a noisy environment the use of a wide-hysteresis amplifier as a squaring circuit offers increased protection against false triggering. An amplifier with hysteresis has two different triggering levels. This helps improve noise immunity. Also, a double-buffered NAND gate can be used as a squaring circuit to minimize the effects of noise.},
