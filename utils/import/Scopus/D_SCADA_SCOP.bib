abstract={Fault detection based on data from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, which has been installed in most MW-scale wind turbines, has brought significant benefits for wind farm operators. However, the changes in the features of hardware sensor measurements, which are used in current SCADA systems, often cannot provide reliable early alarms. In order to resolve this problem, in this paper, a novel dynamic model sensor method is proposed for the SCADA data based wind turbine fault detection. A dynamic model representing the relationship between the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature is derived following the first principles and used as the basic structure of the model sensor. When the model sensor is applied for fault detection, its parameters are updated regularly using the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature data from the SCADA system. Then, from the updated model, the fault sensitive features of wind turbine system are extracted via performing system frequency analysis and used for the turbine fault detection. This novel model sensor method is applied to the SCADA data of a wind farm of 3 wind turbines currently operating in Spain. The results show that the proposed method can not only detect the turbine generator fault but also reveal the trend of ageing with the wind turbine generator, demonstrating its capability of failure prognosis for wind turbine system and components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and supervise our daily infrastructure systems and industrial processes. Hence, the security of the information systems of critical infrastructures cannot be overstated. The effectiveness of unsupervised anomaly detection approaches is sensitive to parameter choices, especially when the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviours are not clearly distinguishable. Therefore, the current approach in detecting anomaly for SCADA is based on the assumptions by which anomalies are defined; these assumptions are controlled by a parameter choice. This paper proposes an add-on anomaly threshold technique to identify the observations whose anomaly scores are extreme and significantly deviate from others, and then such observations are assumed to be ”abnormal”. The observations whose anomaly scores are significantly distant from ”abnormal” ones will be assumed as ”normal”. Then, the ensemble-based supervised learning is proposed to find a global and efficient anomaly threshold using the information of both ”normal”/”abnormal” behaviours. The proposed technique can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection approach to mitigate the sensitivity of such parameters and improve the performance of the SCADA unsupervised anomaly detection approaches. Experimental results confirm that the proposed technique achieved a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of two unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={In this paper, a wind turbine anomaly detection method based on a generalized feature extraction is proposed. Firstly, wind turbine (WT) attributes collected from the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are clustered with k-means, and the Silhouette Coefficient (SC) is adopted to judge the effectiveness of clustering. Correlation between attributes within a class becomes larger, correlation between classes becomes smaller by clustering. Then, dimensions of attributes within classes are reduced based on t-Distributed-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) so that the low-dimensional attributes can be more full and more concise in reflecting the WT attributes. Finally, the detection model is trained and the normal or abnormal state is detected by the classification result 0 or 1 respectively. Experiments consists of three cases with SCADA data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been designed with the assumption that the system would run within a closed environment. They have only generated concerns for security issues that may appear during system deployment, and there are no clear methods to assess security threats when considered. Recent technological and economic trends have driven SCADA systems from serial communication networks to networks based on TCP/IP. This exposes legacy SCADA systems to new security threats they were not designed to defend against. This work examines the viability of machine learning techniques in detecting new security threats specific to SCADA systems and the Modbus protocol. Machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms were used to detect malicious traffic in a generated dataset of Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) communications using the Modbus protocol. The implemented algorithms are Support Vector Machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and k-means clustering. While the algorithms performed well overall, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and K-nearest Neighbors algorithms had the best performance with individual attack types. K-means clustering did not perform satisfactorily with specific attack types. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The challenging task in the research area of network security is to detect and identify the attackers in the network. Intrusion detection system is used to protect the network from attackers and used to block the unauthorized access to network. The existing intrusion detection system has many drawbacks that it can detect only the known attacks and can produce false alarms due to their unpredictable behaviors of the network. To overcome this problem, Enhanced Markov Model (EMM) and Weight Vector Machine (WVM) are proposed to identify and classify the attacks from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network. In this paper attack occurred in the power system dataset is used for analysis. During preprocessing process the relays are segregated from the dataset as S1, S2, S3, and S4. The details of the time, location, date, log report, and load condition are stored in each relay. Then Boyer String (BS) model is proposed to perform the operation of string matching. The WVM is used to identify the known and unknown attacks of the SCADA network. The main objective of this paper is to train the data manually for unknown attacks, to reduce the features and to classify the attacks based on the best feature selection. Experimental results show the better performance in terms of the parameters such as False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Error rate, detection accuracy rate, sensitivity, specificity and recall. © IJSTR 2020.},

abstract={The usage of machine learning techniques is widely spread and has also been implemented in the wind industry in the last years. Many of these techniques have shown great success but need to constantly prove the expectation of functionality. This paper describes a new method to monitor the health of a wind turbine using an undercomplete autoencoder. To evaluate the health monitoring quality of the autoencoder, the number of anomalies before an event has happened are to be considered. The results show that around 35% of all historical events that have resulted into a failure show many anomalies. Furthermore, the wind turbine subsystems which are subject to good detectability are the rotor system and the control system. If only one third of the service duties can be planned in advance, and thereby the scheduling time can be reduced, huge cost saving potentials can be seen. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Specific intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are needed to secure modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems due to their architecture, stringent real-time requirements, network traffic features and specific application layer protocols. This article aims to contribute to assess the state-of-the-art, identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas. To achieve these objectives, we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet environment. Based on that, we provide a brief description and evaluation of 26 selected research papers, published in the period 2015-2019.

abstract={In recent years, automated systems of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) have been widely used in water distribution networks, which have made the distribution system vulnerable to cyber-Attacks. One of the main limitations of the previously proposed cyberattack detection models is that tampering the SCADA's pressure readings would not be reflected on the estimated nodal demands. As a result, cyber-Attacks caused by such manipulations would not be detected. To address this challenge, this paper incorporates pressure readings in the detection algorithm as a constraint and develops a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to estimate the nodal demands of a network, as well as its flow rates and nodal pressure readings. These values are estimated using the SCADA readings for link flows, pump's status, tank's water level, and total demand of a district metering area. Nodal pressure heads are calculated using Bernoulli's and Hazen-Williams equations and pump's head equation. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in SCADA systems has received increased attention from researchers as connectivity to public networks became a necessity in many industries. The nature and characteristics of SCADA systems call for special considerations and techniques of intrusion detection. Many works have been made in this field, ranging from generic intrusion detection techniques to customized solutions designed specifically for SCADA systems. In the recent years, some works have focused on using physical metrics in addition to the popular network-based and host-based intrusion detection approaches. This paper presents a taxonomy that considers the special features of cyberphysical intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with examples from the literature. Moreover, a case study is presented for a simulated gas pipeline dataset to compare the effectiveness of decision tree classifiers for various categories of features in SCADA systems. The results show that an IDS that uses a combination of physical and network metrics significantly outperforms an IDS that only uses network metrics or physical metrics. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Detecting and identifying intrusions in a network is a challenging research area in the network security domain. Intrusion detection plays an essential role in computer network security since long. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is mainly used to detect an unauthorized access to a computer system or network. Moreover, it is capable to detect all types of malicious and harmful attacks in a network. The drawbacks of existing IDS are it can detect only the known attacks and it produces a large number of false alarms due to the unpredictable behavior of users and networks. It also requires extensive training sets in order to characterize the normal behavior of the nodes. In order to overcome these issues, an integration of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)–Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm namely, Probabilistic Relevance Classification (PRC) is proposed to detect intrusions in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network. Here, the power system attack dataset is used to detect the attacks in an SCADA network. In the preprocessing stage, the given data is preprocessed to segregate the relays as R1, R2, R3n and R4. Each relay contains the date, timestamp, control panel log report, relay log report, snort log report, marker, fault location, and load condition information. Then, the Boyer–Moore (BM) technique is employed to perform the string matching operation. After that, the PRC technique is implemented to classify the attack as known or unknown. The novelty of this paper is it manually trains the data and features for unknown attacks. The main intention of this work is to reduce the set of features, amount of database, and to increase the detection rate. The experimental results evaluate the performance in terms of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Genuine Acceptance Rate (GA), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate, and recall. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={The power SCADA systems have been undergoing several upgrades over the years. At first, these systems were based only on isolated processes, without the need to connect in a global network, such as the Internet. In recent years, the access to such an open network has been critical for the SCADA systems, due to the need for data exchange across large areas, between geographically remote industrial plants, or even because of the demand for remote applications. Despite the SCADA systems have advantages by being now connected to a network such as the Internet, several problems can arise due to that. For example, such a connection makes it possible for an intruder to compromise the whole system. SCADA systems are essential in the new concept of smart grids and are widely used in the monitoring and control of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based on photovoltaics. In that context, this paper presents an overview of the main attacks found and documented in the literature, as well as possible techniques to detect such attacks. © 2019 IEEE.},

The gearbox oil pressure difference probability estimation model can be constructed by training the historical normal operating based on SBL.

The abnormal state of gearbox oil pressure difference can be judged by observing whether the actual value within the probability distribution interval. In addition, statistical hypothesis testing method is used to verify the reliability of the anomaly detection results. Through the method, the gearbox oil pressure difference anomaly detection problem can be transformed into a parameter estimation problem with low computational complexity.

abstract={Given the importance of an early anomaly detection, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are introduced in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Agents or probes form the cornerstone of any IDS by capturing network packets and extracting relevant information. However, IDSs are facing unprecedented challenges due to the escalation in the number, scale and diversity of attacks. Software-Defined Network (SDN) then comes into play and can provide the required flexibility and scalability. Building on that, we introduce Traffic Agent Controllers (TACs) that monitor SDN-enabled switches via Open-Flow. By using lightweight statistical metrics such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), we are able to detect the slightest anomalies, such as stealth port scans, even in the presence of background traffic. The obtained metrics can also be used to locate the anomalies with precision over 90% inside a hierarchical network topology. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures crucial to our modern life, such as electricity grids and water pumps, are controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Over the last two decades, connecting critical infrastructures to the Internet has become essential due to performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction, can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)networks are widely deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs)such as energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we design a re-Training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Numerous intelligent fault diagnosis models have been developed on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of wind turbines, so as to process massive SCADA data effectively and accurately. However, there is a problem ignored among these studies. That is, SCADA data distribution is imbalanced and the anomalous data mining is not sufficient. The amount of normal data is much more than that of abnormal data, which makes these models tend to be biased toward majority class, i.e., normal data, while accuracy of diagnosing fault is poor. Aimed at overcoming this problem, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis methodology is proposed based on exquisitely designed deep neural networks. The between-classes imbalance problem is handled by learning deep representation that can preserve within-class information and between-classes information based on triplet loss. The proposed method encourages a pair of data belonging to same class to be projected onto points as close as possible in new embedding space. It tries to enforce a margin between different class data. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method are validated on the SCADA data of two wind turbines containing blades icing accretion fault. The result demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the traditional normal behavior modeling method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increased complexity and interconnectivity of SCADA infrastructure in the power system have exposed it to the multitude of vulnerabilities. There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later, compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Layered inter-network communications, and dynamic control mechanisms of intra-connected testbeds in cyber-physical systems (CPS) paves way for controlling the PLCs and HMIs in a distributive manner. This intuits the idea of monitoring and logging the CPS traffic by embedding the motorized sensor/actuator readings into an IP-network packet. Attackers commence the network packet intervention of a CPS traffic as an initial phase for launching cyber-based attacks over critical public infrastructures. Log sequences captured for such an instance, required the security professional to observe the log sub-sequences that might possibly lead to an attack, unlisted in the signature repository of the existing defense mechanisms. Hence, this paper defines a hypergraph based attack detection model where constraints can be parameterized based on the type of CPS traffic in order to provide adaptable degree of representing possible attack incidents for the existing intrusion detection systems. Post defining the model’s parameterized constraints; we study the attack scenarios over Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset from SUTD’s iTrust lab. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Intrusion detection and prevention system detects malicious activities that occur in the real-time SCADA systems. This system has a problem without a profound solution. The challenge of the existing intrusion detection is accuracy in the process of detecting the anomalies. In SCADA, wind turbine data are modified by the intruders and forged details are given to the server. To overcome this, the biased intrusion detection system is used for detecting the intrusion with encrypted date, time, and file location with less false-positive and false-negative rates and thereby preventing the SCADA system from further intrusion. It is done in three phases. First, Modified Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) is used to extract the features needed for classification and to find the best weight. Second, Entropy-based Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) is used to extort the features and detect the intruded data with its intruded time, file location, and date. Finally, the data are encrypted using the Hybrid Elliptical Curve Cryptography (HECC) to prevent further attack. Experimental results show better accuracy in both detection as well as prevention. © 2019 R. B. Benisha and S. Raja Ratna.},

abstract={In order to reduce the curse of dimensionality of massive data from SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and remove data redundancy, the grey correlation algorithm is used to extract the eigenvectors of monitoring data. The eigenvectors are used as input vectors and the monitoring variables related to the unit state as output vectors. The genetic algorithm and cross validation method are used to optimize the parameters of the support vector regression (SVR) model. A high precision prediction is carried out, and a reasonable threshold is set up to alarm the fault. The condition monitoring of the wind turbine is realized. The effectiveness of the method is verified by using the actual fault data of a wind farm. © 2019 Liang Tao et al.},

abstract={The industry targeted cyber-attacks has increased in the recent years. In addition, digitalizing the instrumentation and control brings new cybersecurity challenges to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system; therefore, the cybersecurity of the SCADA system should be enhanced. This paper proposed an auto-associative kernel regression (AAKR) data-driven model based on network flow data for early attack detection of SCADA system. This model is integrated to the cyber-attack detection system (CADS) proposed before to provide multi-layer defense and better coverage of detectable cyber-attacks. For generating data for the research, a real-time SCADA system test bed was built at the University of Tennessee. It contains a physically modeled thermal-hydraulic part for a typical two-loop nuclear system; a SCADA system based on LabVIEW and a programmable logic controller (PLC); a local area network (LAN)-based cyber network which enables cyber-attacks and data collection. The normal data set and two abnormal data sets fed into the proposed auto-associative kernel regression (AAKR) model were collected under the normal operation, man in the middle (MITM) and denial of service (DoS) attack scenarios, respectively. The result shows that the proposed AAKR model is able to detect the MITM and DoS attacks effectively with almost no false alarms. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved},

abstract={Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks on industrial companies have increased in the last years. The Industrial Internet of Things increases production efficiency, at the cost of an enlarged attack surface. Physical separation of productive networks has fallen prey to the paradigm of interconnectivity, presented by the Industrial Internet of Things. This leads to an increased demand for industrial intrusion detection solutions. There are, however, challenges in implementing industrial intrusion detection. There are hardly any data sets publicly available that can be used to evaluate intrusion detection algorithms. The biggest threat for industrial applications arises from state-sponsored and criminal groups. Often, formerly unknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits. They cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus, statistical or machine learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily. These methods especially, however, need a large amount of labelled training data. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world industrial hardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to control a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A pump, filling and emptying water tanks. This scenario is used to generate application specific network data. Furthermore, attacks are introduced into this data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is monitored and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into this data set. Second, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller program and executed live, the traffic is captured as well. Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller while still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An attacker could exploit an application but forge valid sensor output so that no anomaly is detected. Sensors are employed, capturing temperature, sound and flow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network data and used to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground truth, meaning all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes them perfect for training of anomaly detection algorithms. The data is published to enable security researchers to evaluate intrusion detection solutions. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-Attacks against Critical Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose, designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-Attacks. Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-Attacks. Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge, "Curse of dimensionality". This scenario accentuates the necessity of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall, classification accuracy, and time complexity. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems. There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the increasing installation of wind turbines in remote locations, both onshore and offshore, advanced fault detection and classification strategies have become crucial to accomplish the required levels of reliability and availability. In this work, without using specific tailored devices for condition monitoring but only increasing the sampling frequency in the already available (in all commercial wind turbines) sensors of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, a data-driven multi-fault detection and classification strategy is developed. An advanced wind turbine benchmark is used. The wind turbine we consider is subject to different types of faults on actuators and sensors. The main challenges of the wind turbine fault detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition monitoring in wind turbines. © 2018 by the authors.

Since SCADA networks are static in nature with pre-defined signatures of network traffic, we propose to design an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to detect abnormality in SCADA network traffic and protocols. We gather normal SCADA network traffic via tapping on the network for 30 days and then attack the network using Denial of Service (DoS) attack, message spoofing attack and man-in-the middle attack. We then train a classifier with two classes, normal and abnormal and report the classifier accuracy in detecting abnormal SCADA network traffic. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring. Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F 1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F-1 score of respectively > 99%. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve. Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be determined. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.},

abstract={European Starlings and other bird's flocks in thousands and even millions. Their flocking behaviors attract predators that see such collective behavior as an easy target. However, the surprising thing is that it is harder to target and capture one in their mist than a lone bird. It is easy to target and capture a lone bird than a bird in a flock. One of these collective behaviors is the capability of each of them to detect a predator. Each one in the flock can detect a predator some meters away. The more they are in number, the harder it will be not to detect the incoming predator. This paper proposed modelling the same approach for securing Industrial Control System (ICS) and in particular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, this approach seen in the flock of birds can be replicated in computer system for securing it. Train system was used as a testbed in this paper for data collection. Live data from the train system was collected, analyzed and some risk points were discovered. This risk points were the entry points for anomalies into the system. These are the points that needs securing. The model was to show the viability of using the approach as well as integrating it on SCADA systems, and the train system was a representation of SCADA system. This approach is purely distributed in the sense that each bird is capable of detecting a predator. The detection of anomalies is based on the location of each bird in the system. The bird's environment has cells and each cell has number. The maximum number of birds each cell can contain was six. Six birds approach was used for the detection and this can be seen in the model. Whenever a packet arrives, the first cell that contain six birds will be activated for detection. Birds in the cell has numbers and the activity is based on the number. The results showed that both known and unknow anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

The proposed method is validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and operational conditions. A two-stage cointegration-based procedure is performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data trends have nonlinear characteristics.

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data. The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06%, 37.34%, and 26.76% and improves the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57%, 4.19%, and 3.78% using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Upwind horizontal axis wind turbines need to be aligned with the main wind direction to maximize energy yield. Attempts have been made to improve the yaw alignment with advanced measurement equipment but most of these techniques introduce additional costs and rely on alignment tolerances with the rotor axis or the true north. Turbines that are well aligned after commissioning may suffer an alignment degradation during their operational lifetime. Such changes need to be detected as soon as possible to minimize power losses. The objective of this paper is to propose a three-step methodology to improve turbine alignment and detect changes during operational lifetime with standard nacelle metrology (met) mast instruments (here: Two cup anemometer and one wind vane). In step one, a reference turbine and an external undisturbed reference wind signal, e.g., met mast or lidar are used to determine flow corrections for the nacelle wind direction instruments to obtain a turbine alignment with optimal power production. Secondly a nacelle wind speed correction enables the application of the previous step without additional external measurement equipment. Step three is a monitoring application and allows the detection of alignment changes on the wind direction measurement device by means of a flow equilibrium between the two anemometers behind the rotor. The three steps are demonstrated at two 2MW turbines together with a ground-based lidar. A first-order multilinear regression model gives sufficient correction of the flow distortion behind the rotor for our purposes and two wind vane alignment changes are detected with an accuracy of ±1.4° within 3 days of operation after the change is introduced. We show that standard turbine equipment is able to align a turbine with sufficient accuracy and changes to its alignment can be detected in a reasonably short time, which helps to minimize power losses. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Belt conveyor system is a crucial element of ore transport process in underground copper ore mine. Damage of single belt conveyor might cause stopping of huge part of underground transport network, especially when failure concerns the main haulage conveyor line. For that reason it is important to use SCADA monitoring system. The symptom of damage can be found in increasing temperature measured within the system. Unfortunately, operating belt conveyors can be considered as time-varying system and direct decision making using temperature value is difficult. Long-term analysis of time series enables to learn how to recognize alarming moment. Thus the removal of failure can be scheduled so as to minimize the losses in production. In this paper the clustering method was applied to the long-term observations of the temperature in order to gearbox fault detection. Moreover, the breaks in the activity of belt conveyors (no operation) caused by holidays will be determined. The clustering algorithm identifies also the specific character of the work at the beginning and end of week. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

This paper provides a timing-based anomaly detection system that uses the statistical attributes of the communication patterns. This system is validated with three datasets, one generated from real devices and two from emulated networks, and is shown to have a False Positive Rate (FPR) under 1.4%. The tests are performed in the context of three different attack scenarios, which involve valid messages so they cannot be detected by whitelisting mechanisms. The detection accuracy and timing performance are adequate for all the attack scenarios in request-response communications. With other interaction patterns (i.e. spontaneous communications), we found instead that 2 out of 3 attacks are detected. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={This paper presents a SCADA intrusion detection system test framework that simulates SCADA traffic and detects malicious network activity. The framework combines several existing components such as Kali Linux, Conpot, QTester104 and OpenMUC in a virtual machine based framework to provide realistic SCADA traffic. It is agnostic to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) type, and is demonstrated in a case study comparing two popular signature-based IDS engines: Suricata and Snort. The IDS engines include rule-sets for the IEC 60870-5-104 and other SCADA protocols. Detected events from IDS sensors are sent to a distributed Elastic cluster which visualises them using Kibana dashboards. The experiments show that there is some difference in behaviour between Suricata and Snort’s ability to detect malicious traffic using the same SCADA ruleset, but these issues are relatively easy to mitigate. The IDS test framework also measures the latency from detection and until the IDS alerts are presented in the incident management system, which shows that Suricata has slightly better performance than Snort.

abstract={Alarms affect operations in most part of the ship. Their impact on modern Engine Control Room operations is no less significant. The state of an alarm system serves as an indication of the extent to which the ship's operations are under management control. Thus, the design of efficient and reliable alarm monitoring system is vital for safe and sound operations. Although several design techniques have been proposed, all the proposed design methods employ sophisticated and expensive approaches in resolving alarm issues. In this paper, a cheap, yet reliable and efficient alarm design method for engine room device monitoring is presented. The design method employs PLCs and SCADA-based system and adopts certain basic design requirements of alarm monitoring system presented in literary works. Reasons for such a design method are highlighted, and the programming platforms for the design are given. The strengths and weaknesses of some design methods presented in some published works are reported and solutions to such problems are proposed. The proposed design technique, including fault diagnostic algorithm, have been subjected to real-time online testing at the shipyard, specifically ChangjiangWaterway Bureau, China (ship name-Ning Dao 501). The testing results proved that this design technique is reliable, efficient and effective for online engine control room device monitoring. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

Our technique is evaluated using a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a custom SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave.

abstract={Wind turbines are, generally, placed at remote locations and are subject to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes. Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its statistical performance is also compared with several conventional quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and false isolation. © 2017 IEEE.},

Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In Industrial Control Systems (ICS/SCADA), machine to machine data traffic is highly periodic. Past work showed that in many cases, it is possible to model the traffic between each individual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the SCADA server by a cyclic Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), and to use the model to detect anomalies in the traffic. However, a recent analysis of network traffic in a water facility in the U.S, showed that cyclic-DFA models have limitations. In our research, we examine the same data corpus; our study shows that the communication on all of the channels in the network is done in bursts of packets, and that the bursts have semantic meaning-the order within a burst depends on the messages. Using these observations, we suggest a new burst- DFA model that .ts the data much be.er than previous work. Our model treats the traffic on each channel as a series of bursts, and matches each burst to the DFA, taking the burst's beginning and end into account. Our burst-DFA model successfully explains between 95% and 99% of the packets in the data-corpus, and goes a long way toward the construction of a practical anomaly detection system. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units; however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control devices. A support vector of type 'Class One' machine and a test lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model. © 2017 IEEE.},

However, in developing countries with geographically expansive grid, if the measurements are not GPS time-stamped there are latencies owing to distance of sensor from control center or communication system performance. The latency and resulting time-skews in data fed as input to state estimator program may either be removed as bad data and also result in lack of convergence or poor state estimation.

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used in many applications including power transmission and distribution for situational awareness and control. Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems complexity and interconnectivity increase in recent years have exposed the SCADA networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves improved performance to identify unknown or zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our proposed model has a key effect in reducing the time and computational complexity and achieved improved accuracy and detection rate. The accuracy of our proposed model was measured as 99.5 % for specific-attack-labeled. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the initial findings in applying a behavior-based approach for detection of unauthorized activities in a simulated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Misuse detection of this type utilizes fault-free system telemetry to develop empirical models that learn normal system behavior. Future monitored telemetry sources that show statistically significant deviations from this learned behavior may indicate an attack or other unwanted actions. The experimental test bed consists of a set of Linux based enterprise servers that were isolated from a larger university research cluster. All servers are connected to a private network and simulate several components and tasks seen in a typical SCADA system. Telemetry sources included kernel statistics, resource usages and internal system hardware measurements. For this study, the Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) and Auto Associative Multivariate State Estimation Technique (AAMSET) are employed to develop empirical models. Prognostic efficacy of these methods for computer security used several groups of signals taken from available telemetry classes. The Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is used along with these models for intrusion detection purposes. The different intrusion types shown include host/network discovery, DoS, brute force login, privilege escalation and malicious exfiltration actions. For this study, all intrusion types tested displayed alterations in the residuals of much of the monitored telemetry and were able to be detected in all signal groups used by both model types. The methods presented can be extended and implemented to industries besides nuclear that use SCADA or business-critical networks. Copyright © (2017) by American Nuclear Society.

abstract={SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) databases have three main features that identify them as big data systems: volume, variety and velocity. SCADAs are extremely important for the safety and security operation of modern power system and provide essential online information about the power system state to system operators. A current research challenge is to efficiently process this big data, which involves real-Time measurements of hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important events that affect the system. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Certain mechanical and electrical components, such as generators, exhibit degradation phenomena, which may develop slowly over time or suddenly. The current trend in this field of research is to develop malfunction detection indicators from analog signals recorded by operation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), creating behavioral models of the equipment and the development of a series of status indicators. These models and indicators are used to detect malfunctions when operation SCADA are unable to detect an abnormality, thus determining that the component is beginning to degrade when certain normal limits are exceeded. However, the digital signals from operation SCADA have great potential for providing additional information that could be used to detect possible malfunction. Detection must be accompanied by a study of the remaining life of a component so that the remaining useful life of the component before failure can be estimated before losing its functionality. If SCADA can detect a malfunction and determine when the component will break, the operator will have valuable time to intervene prior to failure at an optimum time. This is particularly important in installations with difficult access, such as offshore wind farms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to multi-threaded scheduling. In previous work we introduced a Statechart model which includes multiple Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), one per cyclic pattern. We demonstrated that Statechart-based anomaly detection is highly effective on multiplexed cyclic traffic when the individual cyclic patterns are known. The challenge is to construct the Statechart, by unsupervised learning, from a captured trace of the multiplexed traffic, especially when the same symbols (ICS messages) can appear in multiple cycles, or multiple times in a cycle. Previously we suggested a combinatorial approach for the Statechart construction, based on Euler cycles in the Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) graph of the trace. This combinatorial approach worked well in simple scenarios, but produced a false-alarm rate that was excessive on more complex multiplexed traffic. In this paper we suggest a new Statechart construction method, based on spectral analysis. We use the Fourier transform to identify the dominant periods in the trace. Our algorithm then associates a set of symbols with each dominant period, identifies the order of the symbols within each period, and creates the cyclic DFAs and the Statechart. We evaluated our solution on long traces from two production ICS: one using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol and the other using Modbus. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulate multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The resulting Statecharts model the traces with an overall median false-alarm rate as low as 0.16% on the synthetic datasets, and with zero false-alarms on production S7-0x72 traffic. Moreover, the spectral analysis Statecharts consistently out-performed the previous combinatorial Statecharts, exhibiting significantly lower false alarm rates and more compact model sizes. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Wind turbine failure and downtime can often compromise the profitability of a wind farm due to their high impact on the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Early detection of failures can facilitate the changeover from corrective maintenance towards a predictive approach. This paper presents a cost-effective methodology to combine various alarm analysis techniques, using data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, in order to detect component failures. The approach categorises the alarms according to a reviewed taxonomy, turning overwhelming data into valuable information to assess component status. Then, different alarms analysis techniques are applied for two purposes: the evaluation of the SCADA alarm system capability to detect failures, and the investigation of the relation between components faults being followed by failure occurrences in others. Various case studies are presented and discussed. The study highlights the relationship between faulty behaviour in different components and between failures and adverse environmental conditions.},

abstract={Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by the electric utility industry to monitor and control electric power generation, transmission and distribution are recognized today as critical components of the electric power delivery infrastructure. SCADA systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate, since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

After that, the Euclidean distance based indicator for system level anomalies is defined and a filter is created to screen out suspicious data points based on quantile function. Moreover, a failure data pattern based criterion is created for anomaly detection from system level. The method is tested with a two-month SCADA dataset with the measurement interval as 20 seconds.

abstract={Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall; accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate may change significantly when considering various attack types and different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical infrastructures. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including electric power, oil & gas and others. The protocols used in this domain were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks, leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic rule generation and (ii) fine-Tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple language grammar allows network engineers to describe system characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS. An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring needs. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of networks within an organization made many critical infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet. CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them, thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable configurations on critical infrastructure network devices. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism. © 2016 IEEE.},

As an example we have shown an application of the technique to the IEC-60870-5-104 protocol and tested the anomaly detector with mixed results. The detection accuracy and false positive rate, as well as real-time response was adequate for 3 of our 4 created attacks.

abstract={SCADA security is an increasingly important research area as these systems, used for process control and automation, are being exposed to the Internet due to their use of TCP/IP protocols as a transport mechanism for control messages. Most of the existing research work on SCADA systems has focused on addressing SCADA security by monitoring at- tacks or anomalies at the network level. The main issue affecting these systems today is that by focusing our attention on network-level monitoring needs, security practitioners may remain unaware of process level constraints. The proposed framework helps ensure that a mechanism is in place to help map process level constraints, as described by process engineers, to network level monitoring needs. Existing solutions have tried to address this problem but have not been able to fully bridge the gap between the process and the network. The goal of this research is to provide a solution that (i) leverages the knowledge process engineers have about the system (to help strengthen cyber security) and that has the ability to (ii) seamlessly monitors process constraints at the network level using standard network security tools. A prototype system for theModbus TCP protocol and the Bro IDS has been built to validate the approach. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={In this work, an early fault detection system for the generator cooling of wind turbines is presented and tested. It relies on a hybrid model of the cooling system. The parameters of the generator model are estimated by an extended Kalman filter. The estimated parameters are then processed by an appropriate statistical change detection algorithm in order to detect faults in the cooling system. To validate the method, it has been tested on 3 years of historical data from 43 turbines. During the testing period, 16 faults occurred; 15 of these were detected by the developed method, and one false alarm was issued. This is an improvement compared with the current system that gives 15 detections and more than 10 false alarms. In some cases, the method detects the fault a long time before the turbine reports an alarm. A further advantage of the method is that it is based on supervisory control and data acquisition data that are available for the operator of all modern turbines. Thereby, the method can be implemented without the need to modify or install additional components in the turbines. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel What-if module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices.

abstract={High profile attacks such as Stuxnet and the cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid have increased research in Industrial Control System (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network security. However, due to the sensitive nature of these networks, there is little publicly available data for researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The lack of representative data sets makes evaluation and independent validation of emerging security solutions difficult and slows down progress towards effective and reusable solutions. This paper presents our work to generate representative labeled data sets for SCADA networks that security researcher can use freely. The data sets include packet captures including both malicious and non-malicious Modbus traffic and accompanying CSV files that contain labels to provide the ground truth for supervised machine learning. To provide representative data at the network level, the data sets were generated in a SCADA sandbox, where electrical network simulators were used to introduce realism in the physical component. Also, real attack tools, some of them custom built for Modbus networks, were used to generate the malicious traffic. Even though they do not fully replicate a production network, these data sets represent a good baseline to validate detection tools for SCADA systems. © 2016 USENIX Association.

abstract={During the past decade wind turbines have proven to be a promising source of renewable power. Wind turbines are generally placed in remote locations and are subject to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes. Consequently, the failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause loss of revenue due to long down times. Asset management in wind turbines can aid in assessing and improving the reliability and availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Maintenance policies play an important role in asset management and different maintenance models have been developed for wind turbine applications. Typically, mathematical models for maintenance optimization provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. Age based preventive maintenance schedules provide the owner with the possibility to financially plan for maintenance activities for the entire lifetime of the wind turbine by providing the expected number of replacements for each component. However, age based preventive maintenance schedule may not consume the operating life of the wind turbine components to the maximum. Condition based maintenance scheduling has the advantage of better utilizing the operating life of the components. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. This paper also presents an artificial neural network (ANN) based condition monitoring method which utilizes data from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to detect failures in wind turbine components and systems. The procedures to construct ANN models for condition monitoring application are outlined. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ANN based condition monitoring method it is applied to case studies from real wind turbines. Furthermore, a mathematical model called preventive maintenance schedule with interval costs (PMSPIC) is discussed and its application to a case study within the maintenance management framework is presented. The case study demonstrates the advantage of combining both the age based and condition based maintenance scheduling methods. © 2016 CIGRE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Detecting and identifying intrusions in a network is a challenging research area in network security domain. Intrusion detection plays an essential role in computer network security since long. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is mainly used to detect an unauthorized access to a computer system or network. Moreover, it is capable to detect all types of malicious and harmful attacks in a network. The drawbacks of existing IDS are, it can detect only the known attacks, it produces a large number false alarms due to the unpredictable behavior of users and networks. It also requires extensive training sets in order to characterize the normal behavior of the nodes. In order to overcome these issues, an integration of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - Relevance Vector Machine RVM) algorithm namely, Probabilistic Relevance Classification (PRC) is proposed to detect intrusions in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network. Here, the power system attack dataset is used to detect the attacks in a SCADA network. In the preprocessing stage, the given data is preprocessed to segregate the relays as R1, R2, R3 and R4. Each relay contains the date, timestamp, control panel log report, relay log report, snort log report, marker, fault location and load condition information. Then, the Boyer Moore (BM) technique is employed to perform the string matching operation. After that, the PRC technique is implemented to classify the attack as known or unknown. The novelty of this paper is, it manually trains the data and features for unknown attacks. The main intention of this work is to reduce the set of features, amount of database and to increase the detection rate. The experimental results evaluate the performance in terms of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Genuine Acceptance Rate (GA), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate and recall.},

abstract={SCADA traffic between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed SCADA streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. In this paper we introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We evaluated our solution on traces from a production SCADA system using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our solution on a collection of synthetically-generated traces. In all but the most extreme scenarios the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems. Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks.

We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI) etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3. The proposed testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures. © 2015 IEEE.},

RTUs collect data from sensors and control actuators situated at remote sites and send data to the MTU through a network. Since RTUs operate in a harsh industrial environment, fault tolerance is a key requirement particularly for safety-critical industrial processes. Studies show that a significant number of transient faults due to a harsh environment result in control flow errors in the RTU’s processors.

For isolation of the leak a lateral extraction is proposed instead of the traditional pressure profile of the pipeline. Friction value is a function of pipe physical parameters, but on line friction estimation achieved better results. Aspects that were important in the integration of the FDI scheme into the SCADA were the non synchrony of pipeline variables (flow, pressure) and their accessibility, that leaded to data extrapolation and the use of data base techniques. Vulnerability of the location algorithm due to sensors bandwidth and sensitivity is showed, so the importance of selecting them.

During its learning phase, the anomaly detection system used the classifier to identify the different types of registers and instantiated the model for each register based on its type. During the enforcement phase, the system detected deviations from the model. The anomaly detection system was evaluated using 131. h of traffic from a production SCADA system. The classifier had a true positive classification rate of 93%. During the enforcement phase, a 0.86% false alarm rate was obtained for the correctly-classified registers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={ICS (Industrial Control System) is a computer-controlled system that monitors and controls distributed field devices for power grid, water treatment and other industrial areas. Because ICS components fulfill their own roles, the network traffic of ICS has obvious regular patterns. These patterns can be used effectively in monitoring ICS network and detecting signs of cyber-attacks. In our previous work, we proposed a burst-based anomaly detection method for DNP3 protocol using the regularity of ICS network traffic. Traffic monitoring method such as switch mirroring causes many problems; packet duplication, packet out-of-order, and packet loss. The problems cause many false alarms. Furthermore, it is hard to decide whether the alarms caused by lost packets are true or false. In this paper, we apply our burst-based approach to TCP protocol in SCADA network and propose a method to manage monitoring problems for burst-based anomaly detection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This paper extends this approach in order to incorporate synchronized phasor measurements, which are provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Branches suspected of having parameters errors are identified through an Identification Index, which is computed based on the normalized residuals of SCADA and PMU measurements. The suspicious branch parameters are estimated in a sequential form using several measurement snapshots of SCADA and PMU measurements. This estimation process is executed via an augmented state-parameter estimator, which increases the conventional V-θ state vector for the inclusion of suspicious branch parameters. Several test results have demonstrated the high correctness and reliability of the proposed approach to treat single and multiple parameter errors in adjacent and non-adjacent branches and even in branches connected in a radial manner forming critical parameter k-tuples. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The massive use of information and communication technologies in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of ${\mbi {l-p}}$-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

The NBMs for 14 temperature parameters of SCADA system are developed by using back propagation neural networks (BPNNs). The proposed method is verified by a case of a 1.5MW WT fault.

abstract={Developing effective wind turbine fault detection algorithm is not only meaningful for improving wind turbine reliability but also crucial for future intelligent wind farm operation and management. Typical wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring is based on vibration signals, which is effective to detect failures with high frequency signal range. But it may not be effective on low speed components which have low frequency signal characteristic of different failure modes. SCADA system collecting multiple low frequency signals provides a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines health and performance, while its capability on fault detection is still an open issue. To systematic understand wind turbine systems, this paper presents research results of model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection. Through a detail analysis of thermodynamic process of gearbox lubrication system, a wind turbine drive train model which considers heat transferring mechanism in gearbox lubrication system is built to derive robust relationships between transmission efficiency, temperature, and rotational speed signals of wind turbine gearbox and suggest useful information for lubrication system design and optimization. The result obtained in this work is useful for wind turbine gearbox design and effective algorithm development of fault detection.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems.

abstract={Advanced false data injection attack in targeted malware intrusion is becoming an emerging severe threat to the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Several intrusion detection schemes have been proposed previously [1, 2]. However, designing an effective real-time detection system for a resource-constraint device is still an open problem for the research community. In this paper, we propose a new relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection attacks at the SCADA system, even when injected data may seemly fall within a valid/normal range. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we design a novel detection model, alternation vectors with state relation graph. Furthermore, we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the injection point(s), i.e., the attack origin, in the system. We evaluate SRID with a real-world power plant simulator. The experiment results show that SRID can detect various false data injection attacks with a low false positive rate at 0.0125%. Meanwhile, SRID can dramatically reduce the search space of attack origins and accurately locate most of attack origins. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a core part of industrial systems, such as smart grid power and water distribution systems. In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase, the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared to three well-known anomaly detection approaches. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={SCADA systems are broadly employed in supervising and controlling industrial areas comprising manufacturing industries, traffic control, power plants, integrated water management systems (distribution, treatment and sewage). The security of SCADA systems represents a significant subject on account of the critical function that these systems perform in offering vital utility services. In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the network control plane and /or the data plane. Critical infrastructures, requiring uninterrupted operation, maintenance, and protection, have need of robust and secured control SCADA systems. The paper intends to depicts the critical architectural constituents of these systems, detect vulnerabilities and possible threats, and illustrate protection techniques that may be set up in order to reduce attacks involving situation awareness solutions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution, and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages. The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111. h of operation. Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured incorrectly. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={When SCADA systems are exposed to public networks, attackers can more easily penetrate the control systems that operate electrical power grids, water plants, and other critical infrastructures. To detect such attacks, SCADA systems require an intrusion detection technique that can understand the information carried by their usually proprietary network protocols. To achieve that goal, we propose to attach to SCADA systems a specification-based intrusion detection framework based on Bro [7][8], a runtime network traffic analyzer. We have built a parser in Bro to support DNP3, a network protocol widely used in SCADA systems that operate electrical power grids. This built-in parser provides a clear view of all network events related to SCADA systems. Consequently, security policies to analyze SCADA-specific semantics related to the network events can be accurately defined. As a proof of concept, we specify a protocol validation policy to verify that the semantics of the data extracted from network packets conform to protocol definitions. We performed an experimental evaluation to study the processing capabilities of the proposed intrusion detection framework. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={The development of electrical control system faults can lead to increased mechanical component degradation, severe reduction of asset performance, and a direct increase in annual maintenance costs. This paper presents a highly accurate data driven classification system for the diagnosis of electrical control system faults, in particular, wind turbine pitch faults. Early diagnosis of these faults can enable operators to move from traditional corrective or time based maintenance policy towards a predictive maintenance strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks and requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach provides transparent, human-readable rules for maintenance operators which have been validated by an independent domain expert. Data from 8 wind turbines was collected every 10 minutes over a period of 28 months with 10 attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Three fault classes are identified: "no pitch fault", "potential pitch fault" and "pitch fault established". Of the turbines, 4 are used to train the system with a further 4 for validation. Repeated random sub-sampling of the majority fault class was used to reduce computational overheads whilst retaining information content and balancing the training and validation sets. A classification accuracy of 85.50% was achieved with 14 human readable rules generated via the RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these rules, 11 were described as "useful and intuitive" by an independent domain-expert. An expert system was developed utilising the model along with domain knowledge, resulting in a pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05% along with a 42.12% reduction in pitch fault alarms.},

Early diagnosis of these faults can enable operators to move from traditional corrective or time based maintenance towards a predictive maintenance strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks and requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach provides transparent, human-readable rules for maintenance operators which have been validated by an independent domain expert. Data from 8 wind turbines was collected every 10 min over a period of 28 months with 10 attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Three fault classes are identified, each represented by 6,000 instances in each of the testing and training sets. Of the turbines, 4 are used to train the system with a further 4 for validation. Repeated random sampling of the majority fault class was used to reduce computational overheads whilst retaining information content and balancing the training and validation sets. A classification accuracy of 85.50 % was achieved with 14 human readable rules generated via the RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these, 11 were described as "useful and intuitive" by an independent domain-expert. An expert system was developed utilising the model along with domain knowledge, resulting in a pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05 % along with a 42.12 % reduction in pitch fault alarms.

abstract={Designed without cyber security in mind, most existing Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems make it a big challenge to modify the conventional Information Technology (IT) intrusion detection techniques, both to counter the threat of cyber attacks due to their standardization and connectivity to the Internet, and to achieve resilient control without fully retrofitting. The author presents a taxonomy and a set of metrics of SCAD-specific intrusion detection techniques by heightening their possible use in addition to explaining the nuance associated with such task and enumerating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that have been proposed to undertake this endeavor. She identifies the deficits and voids in current research and offers recommendations on which strategies are most likely to succeed, in part through presenting a prototype of her efforts towards this goal. Specifically, she introduces an early anomaly detection and resilient estimation scheme consisting of a robust online recursive algorithm, which is based on the Kalman Filter in a state space model setting. This online window limited Robust Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (RGLRT) that the author proposes identifies and detects outliers among real-time multidimensional measurements of dynamical systems without any a priori knowledge of the occurrence time or distribution of the outliers. It attains a low detection delay and an optimal stopping time that yields low rates in false alarm and miss detection while maintaining the optimal online estimation performance under normal conditions. The author proposes a set of qualitative and quantitative metric to measure its optimality in the context of cyber-physical systems. © 2013, IGI Global.},

Automatic controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern.

abstract={High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original measurements including rotor speeds and produced power. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.},

Starting with the basics of heat and temperature, it derives the relationship between temperature, efficiency, and power output or rotational speed based on the first law of thermodynamics. This then leads to a new algorithm based on SCADA oil and bearing temperature measurements to detect gearbox failures. The second case study focuses on extracting diagnostic information from both the enveloped amplitude and oil debris particle count against energy generated of WT. The results show that the analysis of SCADA signals using simple algorithms can give early warning of failures in gearboxes and that analysis of CMS signals can locate and diagnose failures with detailed information. It is suggested that in future WT monitoring systems both SCADA and CMS signals should be used to detect faults and schedule maintenance.},

abstract={A fiber optics based sensing network applicable for fault detection in power system is presented. The proposed scheme is secure and immune from interferences. At each monitoring location, passive rugged fiber-Bragg- gratingbased sensors are deployed. They use fast and compact magnetostrictive transducers instead of current or potential transformers to translate current induced magnetic field into optical signal. These sensors can be compensated for temperature drift and easily be integrated into an optical sensing network. A broadband light source at a substation scans the change in reflected optical power at a unique frequency band that corresponds to the surge in magnetic field associated with an increased fault current at a certain location. A unique feature of this real-time scheme is that it only requires current information for fault detections in both radial and networked systems with various pole structures and line configurations. It can easily coordinate with other protective devices and is free from any time-current coordination curves. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested by simulations. They confirm that the proposed scheme is able to detect the faults irrespective of the type and location. It also performs well in presence of harmonics, high impedance, and sensors malfunctions, as well as sensor noise. PLC/SCADA technology is associated to each sensor allowing the high impedance fault occurrence information to reach the protection equipment located closer to or at the substation.},

abstract={This paper describes a set of anomaly-detection techniques and their applicability to wind turbine fault identification. It explains how the anomaly-detection techniques have been adapted to analyse supervisory control and data acquisition data acquired from a wind farm, automating and simplifying the operators' analysis task by interpreting the volume of data available. The techniques are brought together into one system to collate their output and provide a single decision support environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the accuracy of fault detection. The results presented demonstrate that the interpretation techniques can provide performance assessment and early fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their machines.©2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Pharmaceutical industries which are intended for the packaging of different tablets in a strip of blister need to make sure that the tablets are free from defects before letting them go into the packing box. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient, reliable and cost effective Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System for detection and removing of unwanted tablet(s) strips. The system detects defective tablets by capturing image of a batch of tablets and performs morphological analysis over it. If a defective tablet is found, the system is smart enough to trace in which strip the defective tablet would be present after cutting of batch and hence instructing the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) to remove that strip. The status of the whole process at the completion of every order is sent to Master Terminal Unit (MTU) which generates and saves the log file on MS-EXCEL, and is also able to send the log file to main server via Electronic Mail.},

abstract={Pointer taintedness is a concept which has been successfully employed as basis for vulnerability analysis of C/C++ source code, and as a run-time mitigation technique against memory corruption attacks. Nevertheless, pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis may have no visibility on certain low-level vulnerabilities since there may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are related to a dynamic organization of data in memory. In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of industrial control protocols. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems represent a vulnerability in vital infrastructures. For example, an electric power system is subjected to intrusions via its SCADA systems; however, the instrumentation provides detectable variations in response to such interference. Presented herein is a strategy that augments state estimation methods using a Hybrid Fuzzy System for fault monitoring and diagnosis that aims to combine information from multiple domains in order to detect, isolate, identify, and mitigate threats to the system. Furthermore, to endow the state estimation solution methods with some degree of numerical robustness, algorithm-based error detection (ABED) is applied to the Gaussian elimination procedure. Simulation results revealed that ABED provides error detection at low costs and excellent error coverage for floating point arithmetic in the presence of permanent bit and word errors while being free of false alarms and insensitive to both data range and data size.

abstract={Most critical infrastructure such as chemical processing plants, electrical generation and distribution networks, and gas distribution is monitored and controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA. These systems have been the focus of increased security and there are concerns that they could be the target of international terrorists. With the constantly growing number of internet related computer attacks, there is evidence that our critical infrastructure may also be vulnerable. Researchers estimate that malicious online actions may cause $75 billion at 2007. One of the interesting countermeasures for enhancing information system security is called intrusion detection. This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

abstract={With the increase of the age of the transport oil pipeline and the man-made destruction to pipeline, leaks are often found. The system for pipeline leakage detection and location must be established to find leakage and locate the leak positions to reduce serious environmental pollution and economic loss caused by leakage. The negative pressure wave method is an effective way to locate the leak position, because over 98 percent pipe leakage in China is paroxysmal. There is a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system to monitor operation for long transport petroleum pipe, but the function of leakage detection and location is not included in existing SCADA system in China. This paper used Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) method to obtain pipe operation parameters such as pressure, flow rate, temperature, bump current, valve position and so on from the SCADA system. That takes full advantage of the abundant data collection function of the SCADA system to provide data for leakage detection and location. The wavelet packet analysis-based fault diagnosis method can directly use the change of parameters such as energy of frequency component to detect faults without system model. In the paper, a wavelet packet analysis-based characteristic extraction method is used to extract the characteristic information of leak pressure signals. The eigenvector indexes along with the parameters obtained from the SCADA system can be used to avoid false alarms. Wavelet analysis was used to locate leak positions accurately in this paper. Such a wavelet analysis-based leakage detection and location scheme embedded in the SCADA system has been successfully applied to a pipeline in PetroChina. Practical run demonstrated its well effect.
