abstract = "The merging of power grid, information, and communication technology promotes the intelligent development of smart grid, which is also more prone to cyber attack threats. Especially, the intelligently designed False Data Injection (FDI) attacks severely disturb the normal management and state estimation operations in power system. In this paper, the graphical detection technology which uses Graph Network (GN) is developed for detecting tampered measurements without external knowledge and manual preprocess of historical data. To solve the detection of FDI attacks location issue from the diversified dimensionality in power systems, the Capsule Network combined with GN is developed, which can extract preserve the detailed properties around each note such as location, direction, connection, etc. To evaluate the superior performance of proposed method, the proposed detection technology is carried out through standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect FDI attacks accurately with different attack sparsity and magnitude of disturbances."

First, a novel supervisory strategy is proposed based on the concept of packet reception rate, which can detect the behavior of a DoS attacker during a given time window. A quantitative description of the relationship among attack times, time window, attack success rate and packet reception rate is analyzed. Based on the attack detection information, the current state under attack can be successfully reconstructed by some past available states. Then, a co-design compensation mechanism is also obtained, which can further guarantee the attacked system is stochastically stable (without the zero-mean Gaussian white noise) or mean square exponentially ultimately bounded (with the zero-mean Gaussian white noise). The corresponding design conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example are given to show the effectiveness and superiority of the presented design method."

Failure and faulty diagnosis is one of the most complicated and dynamic problems in the industrial plant management since most of failures are extremely ambiguous which needs to be solved based on an expert’s experience. This makes the solutions very subjective and requires too much time, efforts and monetary investment. In this paper, we are proposing new failure detection approach with machine learning and human expertise by using alarm data. As the first step of developing this new method, we collected several types of alarm data that detected functional failure in Hyundai Steel factory. We analyzed and processed the alarm data with 35 domain experts. Based on the data, we propose a knowledge based system which is Ripple Down Rule-based. This system acquires knowledge by machine learning which is maintained by human experts. The evaluation results showed that the proposed failure detection framework can reduce the time of human expertise acquisition and the cost of solving over-generalization and over-fitting problems by using machine learning techniques."

Operation of stage-based CPSs (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art IIDSs directly address cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O CPSs."

Multiple attack scenarios were studied and the proposed state estimation method was found to excel in detecting attacks conducted on sensors within the system; provided that not all sensors are compromised during the attack. However, the proposed methods for subsequent isolation and correction faced limitations due to delays or lack of information to pinpoint the attacked component.

abstract = "False data injection (FDI) attacks are crucial security threats to smart grid cyber-physical system (CPS), and could result in cataclysmic consequences to the entire power system. However, due to the high dependence on open information networking, countering FDI attacks is challenging in smart grid CPS. Most existing solutions are based on state estimation (SE) at the highly centralized control center; thus, computationally expensive. In addition, these solutions generally do not provide a high level of security assurance, as evidenced by recent work that smart FDI attackers with knowledge of system configurations can easily circumvent conventional SE-based false data detection mechanisms. In this paper, in order to address these challenges, a novel distributed host-based collaborative detection method is proposed. Specifically, in our approach, we use a conjunctive rule based majority voting algorithm to collaboratively detect false measurement data inserted by compromised phasor measurement units (PMUs). In addition, an innovative reputation system with an adaptive reputation updating algorithm is also designed to evaluate the overall running status of PMUs, by which FDI attacks can be distinctly observed. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted with real-time measurement data obtained from the PowerWorld simulator, and the numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal."

abstract = "This paper proposes a frequency-based approach for the detection of replay attacks affecting cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular, the method employs a sinusoidal signal with a time-varying frequency (authentication signal) into the closed-loop system and checks whether the time profile of the frequency components in the output signal are compatible with the authentication signal or not. In order to carry out this target, the couplings between inputs and outputs are eliminated using a dynamic decoupling technique based on vector fitting. In this way, a signature introduced on a specific input channel will affect only the output that is selected to be associated with that input, which is a property that can be exploited to determine which channels are being affected. A bank of band-pass filters is used to generate signals whose energies can be compared to reconstruct an estimation of the time-varying frequency profile. By matching the known frequency profile with its estimation, the detector can provide the information about whether a replay attack is being carried out or not. The design of the signal generator and the detector are thoroughly discussed, and an example based on a quadruple-tank process is used to show the application and effectiveness of the proposed method."

When the storage, processing, and communication of a reasonable amount of data migrate to those mobile and embedded devices, it becomes strenuous to apply conventional powerful algorithms for identifying, eliminating, and tolerating the faulty data because of the resource constraints of these devices. Further, the real-time requirements of CPS applications require CPSs to respond quickly and the aggregation method that is long-established in CPSs makes it challenging to ascertain the value of the original data. Thus, a systematic approach is essential to accomplish the goal of faulty data detection and filtering. In this paper, we present several approaches that we can deploy to detect and filter faulty data efficiently and cost-effectively, to improve the quality of the collected data from a system’s perspective to match the specific requirements of CPSs."

The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input–output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of T-detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies T-detectability property for a finite T, this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems."

With replay attacks, attacker records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and output, respectively. Moreover, the output-based detector has more low-computing solution process than the residual-based one. Finally, a practical example is proposed to demonstrate the superiority of the stochastic coding scheme."

Still CPS is considered as a nascent technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These challenges are often posed due to the complexity of communication, computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living, environmental control and traffic management. Unfortunately, no unified architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations among the applications. In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few CPS healthcare architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all lack of efficient false alarm detection. In this paper, a novel false alarm detection architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare applications."

As a result, it is of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper, from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs. First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective. Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally, some challenge issues are raised for the future research."

In NCSs, both the communication links and the physical system are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and hence, it is of utmost importance to detect them and mitigate their effect on the system. The network and physical system dynamics will become stochastic and uncertain due to packet losses and random delays from the network. Moreover, the overall NCS can become unstable with an increase in delays and packet losses due to attacks. In this chapter, both cyber- (or network) and physical system dynamics of an NCS are considered linear initially and then nonlinear. In both cases, by using a state-space representation of the communication network, controllers are designed to stabilize the traffic flow in the network and the NCS by using Q-learning in the case of a linear NCS and neural networks in the case of a nonlinear NCS. The attack detection and estimation are accomplished by using residual signals that are generated from novel adaptive observers. Also, the detectability conditions are derived and the maximum delay and packet loss bound are given before the NCS becomes unstable. Simulation results are given."

Additional advantages of this design for ICPSs include the enhanced fault detectability, inherent scalability, and accelerated computation efficiency.

abstract = "In this paper, we address the problem of finding the moment at which an attack to a cyber-physical system initiates, which we call the “moment of attack.” The proposed algorithm is not a real-time method, but the search is performed a posteriori. Nevertheless, the problem becomes of particular interest for forensic evidence, or for high-cost manufacturing processes. In fact, when a production system is attacked, the manufactured output before the attack does not have to be discarded if exact time of the attack is found. To tackle the problem for “temporarily stealthy” sensor attack of polynomial types (with which the conventional real-time anomaly detectors hardly estimate the moment of attack), we propose a batch-type detection algorithm for the moment of attack via the back-and-forth observer approach."

abstract = "Industrial Cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), integrating communication, computation and control of industrial processes are referred to as a core technology to approach the Industry 4.0. Ensuring the ICPS security is of paramount importance in smart manufacturing. Considering the characteristics of large-scale, geographically-dispersed and multi-dimensional heterogeneous, federated and life-critical natures of ICPSs, this paper investigates a hierarchically distributed intrusion detection scheme that seeks to achieve the all-round safety protection of ICPSs according to the system structure and attacking types of each ICPS layer. For physical system-relevant perceptual executive layer, potential and covert attacks are detected by the clustered sensory system state residual anomaly monitoring based on a process noise and measurement noise-adaptive Kalman filter (PNMN-AKF). PNMN-AKF can perform a joint recursive estimation of dynamic system states, time-varying process and measurement noise covariance matrices by the variational Bayes approximation framework. In cyberspace, potential cyber-attacks are detected by the anomaly monitoring of the statistical distribution of the network transmission characteristics of data transmission layer by introducing a forgetting factor-induced recursive Gaussian mixture model (FF-RGMM). In the application control layer, a regularized sparse deep belief network model is introduced to characterize the misuse behavior for detecting potential attacks. Extensive validation and comparative experiments have been conducted on a numerical simulation system and a comprehensive ICPS simulation platform by using OPNET and a commonly-used benchmark simplified Tennessee Eastman process (STEP) based on Matlab/Simulink. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically distributed intrusion detection method can efficiently recognize potential and covert cyber-attacks in each ICPSs link with low false alarm rate and missing detection rate, which lays a foundation for the overall security monitoring of ICPSs."

abstract = "We study the problem of detecting an attack on a stochastic cyber-physical system. We start by proposing a detection criterion based on checking the statistics of the Kalman prediction error. To show the importance of the proposed criterion, we study certain attacking schemes which can be effectively detected by this criterion, but not by checking simpler conditions based on commonly used statistics. We then use the proposed criterion to derive a detection algorithm. This algorithm is based on a statistical confidence test, giving a confidence level for detecting an attack. We present simulation results to illustrate the performance of this algorithm."

abstract = "We consider periodic watermarking scheduling for detecting discontinuous replay attacks in Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs). The existing methods of imposing continuous watermarks on the nominal control inputs may result in the waste of control cost when system detectors are not sensitive to the added watermarks, since the attacker may be absent for a considerably long time. For example, in the famous Stuxnet event, the attacker only launches the attack for a short period each month in order to avoid being detected. In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Both complexes demonstrate stability and strong characteristic luminescence emissions in organic and water media. They also possess excellent luminescence sensing activities toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72−/CrO42− in DMF and aqueous solutions as well as simulated biological system. Notably, Tb-CP is one of the very few examples to effectively distinguish between CrO42− and Cr2O72− in aqueous and HEPES media. Both CPs could be simply and quickly regenerated at least five circles. The research on sensing mechanism indicated that the luminescence quenching may be related with the energy competition and weak interactions between CPs and sensing analytes."

In this study, we elucidated a novel, facile, and highly selective Chemo-Paper-Sensor (CPS) for detection and monitoring of strontium (Sr2+) ions, which means a potent colorimetric sensor based on a Chrysoidine G (CG)-coated paper strip. The CPS for highly selective colorimetric detection of strontium ion was handily analyzed to determine the red-green-blue (RGB) value using portable devices such as desktop digital scanner and mobile phone camera, quantitatively. Interestingly, an orange to dark orange color transition was observed when the aqueous and solid paper colorimetric sensor was introduced to Sr2+ ion, respectively. It was demonstrated that the value of the signal has a linear relationship with concentrations of the strontium in the 500 ppm to 100 ppb range with a detection limit of 200 ppb. We believe that a newly developed Chemo-Paper-Sensor will be useful in a wide range of sensing applications."

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that all CPs featured a two dimensional (2D) layer with (6, 6, 6)-connected 63 topology. Luminescent spectra demonstrate that CPs 1–7 exhibit impressive UV–visible luminescence in the solid state at room temperature. More significantly, a single-component white-light material with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of (0.335, 0.334) for 4 (Sm-CP), very closing to the pure white-light of (0.333, 0.333) was obtained by finely tuning of the excitation wavelength. In addition, the luminescent detection for anions of 7 is investigated. Fluorescence measurements show that 7 can detect oxoanion pollutants Cr2O72−, CrO42−, and MnO4− anions in aqueous solutions with high selectivity and sensitivity, which suggests that the Tb-CP is a promising functional luminescence probe for toxic oxoanions. The possible mechanisms of the quenching effect were also discussed in detail."
