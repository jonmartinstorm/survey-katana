abstract = "Cyber attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) to disrupt the associated physical systems, like power grids and water treatment plants, are a harsh reality of the world today. Detection and prevention of anomalous behaviors such as cyber attacks are of vital importance. This paper focuses on a method to detect such anomalous behaviors in near real-time using laptop class processing power. ICSs depend on the sensor measurements to monitor and operate a plant. Moreover, any change in the behaviors of a physical process due to an attack can also be unearthed from the sensor measurements. Under different circumstances, these sensor measurements follow typical patterns. A partially defined Boolean function based supervised classification method, known as Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), can extract patterns (or rules) from historical sensor measurements, and these rules can categorize the condition of a plant. In this paper, these rules are used to design an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) to unearth anomalous behaviors. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed using the sensor measurements from a testbed known as Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. The proposed technique is generic and can be extended to other ICSs such as power and transportation. Additionally, compared to other anomaly detection approaches, LAD-based ADS also helps to localize the anomaly."

abstract = "Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries’ industrial facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems."

However, malware such as Stuxnet has demonstrated the ability to alter industrial control system parameters to create physical effects. Of particular concern is malware that targets embedded devices that monitor and control system functionality, while masking the actions from plant operators and security analysts. Indeed, system security relies on guarantees that the assurance of these devices can be maintained throughout their lifetimes. This paper presents a novel approach that uses timing-based side channel analysis to establish a unique device fingerprint that helps detect unauthorized modifications of the device. The approach is applied to an Allen Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controller where execution time measurements are collected and analyzed by a custom anomaly detection system to detect abnormal behavior. The anomaly detection system achieves true positive rates of 0.978–1.000 with false positive rates of 0.033–0.044. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of using timing-based side channel analysis to detect anomalous behavior in programmable logic controllers."

abstract = "Industrial control systems (ICS) are moving from dedicated communications to switched and routed corporate networks, exposing them to the Internet and placing them at risk of cyber-attacks. Existing methods of detecting cyber-attacks, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs), are commonly implemented in ICS and SCADA networks. However, these devices do not detect more complex threats that manifest themselves gradually over a period of time through a combination of unusual sequencing of activities, such as process-related attacks. During the normal operation of ICSs, ICS devices record device logs, capturing their industrial processes over time. These logs are a rich source of information that should be analysed in order to detect such process-related attacks. In this paper, we present a novel process mining anomaly detection method for identifying anomalous behaviour and cyber-attacks using ICS data logs and the conformance checking analysis technique from the process mining discipline. A conformance checking analysis uses logs captured from production systems with a process model (which captures the expected behaviours of a system) to determine the extent to which real behaviours (captured in the logs) matches the expected behaviours (captured in the process model). The contributions of this paper include an experimentally derived recommendation for logging practices on ICS devices, for the purpose of process mining-based analysis; a formalised approach for pre-processing and transforming device logs from ICS systems into event logs suitable for process mining analysis; guidance on how to create a process model for ICSs and how to apply the created process model through a conformance checking analysis to identify anomalous behaviours. Our anomaly detection method has been successfully applied in detecting ICS cyber-attacks, which the widely used IDS Snort does not detect, using logs derived from industry standard ICS devices."

The different devices within the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection of ICS. Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure. Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of deep learning to design our detection model. Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed detection models is that the models are adaptive where training procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks. Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes, learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms and obtain similar performances with earlier semi-supervised work (Huda et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model."

This paper investigates the attack signal estimation for intrusion detection of actuator false data injection attacks. Taking advantage of extended state observer, the attack signal is described as system disturbance and can be estimated. We propose two attack signal estimators, i.e., linear attack signal estimator (LASE) and nonlinear attack signal estimator (NASE). Through the analysis in the frequency domain, the influence of the attack signal frequency on the estimation performance of LASE is obtained. Both simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed estimators can achieve good performance."

In addition, despite all the security solutions in place, unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability, that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS. We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution’s applicability to networked robot control systems."

Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked, out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID, which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared to traditional on-chip sensors."

Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 μm copper process line were used to compare the current design with the conventional testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width.

abstract = "In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper."

abstract = "The electronic industry has been experiencing a growing counterfeit market, resulting in electronic supply chains in other industries to be prone to counterfeit parts as well. Over the past few years, several methods have been developed for evaluating the reliability of an IC and distinguishing them as counterfeit or authentic. Trained experts offer services for evaluating an IC based on destructive or non-destructive methods. However, defect detection and recognition are mostly dependent on human decision, and therefore are vulnerable to error. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect and identify die-face delamination on an IC die. Die-face delamination is a predominant internal defect in recycled ICs but can be easily missed during defect detection. Here, we have acquired the 3D image of an IC non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography and applied image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms on the 3D image to detect die-face delamination in the forms of thermally induced cracks and damaged surfaces."

abstract = "Using the PEG-trypsinisation assay, HBsAG-CICs were detected in 70% of patients with acute hepatitis B, in 5% of the asymptomatic HBsAg carriers and, in addition, in each of the 2 cases of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In serial examinations, the complexed HBsAg levels in 77% of patients with acute hepatitis B decreased progressively in parallel with the free HBsAg levels, and persisted in the remaining 23%. In 19% of patients positive for HBsAg-CICs, the complexed HBsAg levels were higher than those of free HBsAG. No correlation was observed between results of PEG-trypsinisation and an anticomplementary assay. Artificial HBsAg-ICs in antigen excess were found to be poorly anticomplementary. C3 concentrations were normal or elevated in the majority (88%) of sera positive for HBsAg-CICs. These findings suggest that HBsAg-CICs in antigen excess are unlikely to be complement-activating. The method is useful for clinical investigation and for routine examination for HBsAg-CICs."

abstract = "An antigen-specific method has been developed for direct detection and quantitation of HBsAg-ICs. The method involves (1) precipitation of HBsAg-ICs with 3.5% PEG; (2) dissociation of the PEG precipitated ICs by treatment with NaSCN, NaI, KBr, low or high pH buffers, trypsin or papain; and (3) detection and titration of HBsAg and/or anti-HBs liberated from ICs. Treatment with 2 M and 3 M NaSCN, papain or trypsin liberates HBsAg, while following treatment with 3 M NaI free anti-HBs is detectable. Trypsin digestion (2 mg/ml, 30 min at 37°C) proved to be most effective for disrupting HBsAg-ICs formed at equivalence as well as in excess of antigen or antibody. After trypsin digestion of the sample RPHA, RIA and ELISA may be used as a third step. The method was developed and standardized by the use of artificial HBsAg-ICs."
