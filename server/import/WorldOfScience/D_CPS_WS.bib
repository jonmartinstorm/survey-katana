Abstract = {{Since fault injection attack can be utilized to corrupt the data or
   deduce the secret key of sensitive information, we approach the fault
   detection design of confidential real-time applications running on Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPSs) to resist fault injection attacks. We choose
   cryptographic service to implement confidentiality protection for
   messages delivered over distributed CPSs, and deploy fault detection
   within confidential algorithm to resist fault injection attacks. We
   establish the fault dispersion model and the fault coverage model of ten
   fault detection schemes to quantify the security strength. We formulate
   the design problem as a system-level multi-objective optimization
   problem and then make efforts to search for the best fault detection
   schemes for the encryption/decryption of messages with the constraints
   of deadline and execution dependency.We propose an efficient approach
   based on traditional multi-objective evolutionary mechanisms, which can
   obtain better solutions with lower time complexity. Extensive
   experiments and a real-life application are conducted to evaluate the
   efficiency of the proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The merging of power grid, information, and communication technology
   promotes the intelligent development of smart grid, which is also more

   paper, the graphical detection technology which uses Graph Network (GN)
   is developed for detecting tampered measurements without external

   detection of FDI attacks location issue from the diversified
   dimensionality in power systems, the Capsule Network combined with GN is
   developed, which can extract preserve the detailed properties around
   each note such as location, direction, connection, etc. To evaluate the
   superior performance of proposed method, the proposed detection
   technology is carried out through standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus
   systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   detect FDI attacks accurately with different attack sparsity and

Abstract = {{In this article, an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) is utilized
   for monitoring critical events such as structural equipment conditions
   in industrial environments. Such a system can easily be a point of
   attraction for the cyberattackers, in addition to system faults, severe
   resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy), and environmental
   problems. This makes data collection in the ICPS untrustworthy, even the
   data are altered after the data forwarding. Without validating this
   before data aggregation, detection of an event through the aggregation
   in the ICPS can be difficult. This article introduces TrustData, a
   scheme for high-quality data collection for event detection in the ICPS,
   referred to as ``Trust worthy and secured Data collection{''} scheme. It
   alleviates authentic data for accumulation at groups of sensor devices
   in the ICPS. Based on the application requirements, a reduced quantity
   of data is delivered to an upstream node, say, a cluster head. We
   consider that these data might have sensitive information, which is
   vulnerable to being altered before/after transmission. The contribution
   of this article is threefold. First, we provide the concept of TrustData
   to verify whether or not the acquired data are trustworthy (unaltered)
   before transmission, and whether or not the transmitted data are secured
   (data privacy is preserved) before aggregation. Second, we utilize a
   general measurement model that helps to verify acquired signal
   untrustworthy before transmitting toward upstream nodes. Finally, we
   provide an extensive performance analysis through a real-world dataset,
   and our results prove the effectiveness of TrustData.}},

Title = {{An energy-aware cyber physical system for energy Big data analysis and
   recessive production anomalies detection in discrete manufacturing
   workshops}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{With the development of sensing and communications technology, some new
   features have emerged in manufacturing processes, such as highly
   correlated, deeply integrated, dynamically integrated, and a huge volume
   of data. There is a strong need to deeply excavate information from
   manufacturing Big Data, especially the energy consumption data, for
   energy-efficient manufacturing operations management and analysis.
   However, relevant data reduction and association analysis to support
   energy-efficient manufacturing are still ineffective and error-prone,
   especially for discrete manufacturing workshops. In this paper, an
   energy-aware Cyber Physical System (E-CPS) is proposed for energy Big
   Data analysis and recessive production anomalies detection. Firstly,
   E-CPS is introduced to acquire manufacturing Big Data. Then, a Big Data
   analysis method, including data reduction and data association analysis,
   is proposed to analyse the manufacturing data in the E-CPS. Considering
   the complexity and dynamics of manufacturing processes, an energy Big
   Data-driven recessive production anomalies analysis method is proposed
   based on deep belief networks. The proposed method in this paper
   realises the integrated utilisation of production Big Data and energy
   Big Data in the E-CPS. Further, the efficiency evaluation and recessive
   anomalies detection methods can be used in existing production
   information systems.}},

Abstract = {{A cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry
   4.0. It is an integrated system that merges computing, sensors, and
   actuators, controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrate people
   and cyberspace. However, CPS performance is limited by its computational
   complexity. Finding a way to implement CPS with reduced complexity while
   incorporating more efficient diagnostics, forecasting, and equipment
   health management in a real-time performance remains a challenge.
   Therefore, the study proposes an integrative machine-learning method to
   reduce the computational complexity and to improve the applicability as
   a virtual subsystem in the CPS environment. This study utilizes random
   forest (RF) and a time-series deep-learning model based on the long
   short-term memory (LSTM) networking to achieve real-time monitoring and
   to enable the faster corrective adjustment of machines. We propose a
   method in which a fault detection alarm is triggered well before a
   machine fails, enabling shop-floor engineers to adjust its parameters or
   perform maintenance to mitigate the impact of its shutdown. As
   demonstrated in two empirical studies, the proposed method outperforms
   other times-series techniques. Accuracy reaches 80\% or higher 3 h prior
   to real-time shutdown in the first case, and a significant improvement
   in the life of the product (281\%) during a particular process appears
   in the second case. The proposed method can be applied to other complex
   systems to boost the efficiency of machine utilization and productivity.}},

   nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS) and industrial Internet of Things
   systems, which work through shared communication networks. In this
   article, a class of n-order nonlinear systems is considered as a model
   of CPS while it is in presence of cyber attacks only in the forward
   channel. An intelligent-classic control system is developed to
   compensate cyber-attacks. Neural network (NN) is designed as an
   intelligent estimator for attack estimation and a classic nonlinear
   control system based on the variable structure control method is
   designed to compensate the effect of attacks and control the system
   performance in tracking applications. In the proposed strategy,
   nonlinear control theory is applied to guarantee the stability of the
   system when attacks happen. In this strategy, a Gaussian radial basis
   function NN is used for online estimation and reconstruction of
   cyber-attacks launched on the networked system. An adaptation law of the
   intelligent estimator is derived from a Lyapunov function. Simulation
   results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed
   strategy in car cruise control application as the testbed.}},

Abstract = {{A series of isostructural lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs),
   {[}Ln(Hbptc)(H2O)(4)]center dot H2O {[}Ln = Er (1), Pr (2), Dy (3), Sm
   (4), Gd (5), Nd (6) and Tb(7); H(4)bptc = 2,3,3',4'-biphenyl
   tetracarboxylic acid] have been isolated based on an unsymmetrical
   tetracarboxylic acid. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals
   that all CPs featured a two dimensional (2D) layer with (6, 6,
   6)-connected 6(3) topology. Luminescent spectra demonstrate that CPs 1-7
   exhibit impressive UV-visible luminescence in the solid state at room
   temperature. More significantly, a single-component white-light material
   with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of
   (0.335, 0.334) for 4 (Sm-CP), very closing to the purewhite-light of
   (0.333, 0.333) was obtained by finely tuning of the excitation
   wavelength. In addition, the luminescent detection for anions of 7 is
   investigated. Fluorescence measurements show that 7 can detect oxoanion
   pollutants Cr2O72-, CrO42-, and MnO4- anions in aqueous solutions with
   high selectivity and sensitivity, which suggests that the Tb-CP is a
   promising functional luminescence probe for toxic oxoanions. The
   possible mechanisms of the quenching effect were also discussed in
   detail. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In connection with anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, we
   suggest in this paper a new way of modelling large systems consisting of
   a huge number of sensors, actuators and controllers. We base the
   approach on analytical methods usually used in kinetic gas theory, where
   one tries to describe the overall behavior of a gas without looking at
   each molecule separately. We model the system as a multi-agent network
   and derive predictions on the behavior of the network as a whole. These
   predictions can then be used to monitor the operation of the system. If
   the deviation between the predictions and the measured attributes of the
   operational cyber-physical system is sufficiently large, the monitoring
   system can raise an alarm. This way of modelling the normal behavior of
   a cyber-physical system has the advantage over machine learning methods
   mainly used for this purpose, that it is not based on the effective
   operation of the system during a training phase, but rather on the
   specification of the system and its intended use. It will detect
   anomalies in the system's operation independent of their source-may it
   be an attack, a malfunction or a faulty implementation.}},

   problems for cyber-physical systems under attacked situation. To begin
   with, an overall system is constructed for the network of dynamic system

   the original subsystem can be transferred on to the overall system.
   After this, for the overall system, a sliding mode observer that is
   robust to the disturbance but sensitive to the sensor attack is designed
   as sensor attack detector to issue an alarm when at least one subsystem
   is attacked. In addition, we cope with the sensor fault isolation
   problem by building an augmented descriptor system for the overall
   system and we further prove that the precondition can be kept for the
   augmented descriptor system. Then, another robust sliding mode observer
   is designed to reach the goal of attack isolation. Finally, a simulation
   example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

   Devices: Smart-Grid Case}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical
   infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The
   emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure
   that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase
   efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised
   devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges.
   Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid
   information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral
   detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart
   grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,
   we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify
   compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and
   function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical
   analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral
   characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a
   realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both
   resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our
   framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device
   scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of
   our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting
   compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call
   tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate
   for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance
   metrics include accuracy values between 95\% and 99\% for the different
   attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that
   the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid
   devices' computing resources.}},

Title = {{Optimal periodic watermarking schedule for replay attack detection in

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We consider periodic watermarking scheduling for detecting discontinuous
   replay attacks in Cyber- Physical Systems (CPSs). The existing methods
   of imposing continuous watermarks on the nominal control inputs may
   result in the waste of control cost when system detectors are not
   sensitive to the added watermarks, since the attacker may be absent for
   a considerably long time. For example, in the famous Stuxnet event, the
   attacker only launches the attack for a short period each month in order
   to avoid being detected. In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time
   attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by
   exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy
   which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal
   periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection
   performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Abstract = {{The preeminent challenge when data is compiled from cyber-physical
   system is the detection and filtering of faulty data. When the storage,
   processing, and communication of a reasonable amount of data migrate to
   those mobile and embedded devices, it becomes strenuous to apply
   conventional powerful algorithms for identifying, eliminating, and
   tolerating the faulty data because of the resource constraints of these
   devices. Further, the real-time requirements of CPS applications require
   CPSs to respond quickly and the aggregation method that is
   long-established in CPSs makes it challenging to ascertain the value of
   the original data. Thus, a systematic approach is essential to
   accomplish the goal of faulty data detection and filtering. In this
   paper, we present several approaches that we can deploy to detect and
   filter faulty data efficiently and cost-effectively, to improve the
   quality of the collected data from a system's perspective to match the

Abstract = {{The introduction of the cyber-physical system (CPS) into power systems
   has created a variety of communication requirements and functions that
   existing legacy systems do not support. To this end, the IEEE 1815.1
   standard defines the mapping between existing distributed network
   protocol networks and IEC 61850 networks that reflect new requirements.
   However, advanced CPS cyberattacks have been reported, and in order to
   address cyberattacks, security research on new power systems that use
   network devices and heterogeneous communication is necessary. In this
   study, we propose an intrusion detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based
   power system using CPS. We 1) analyze an IEEE 1815.1-based power system
   network and propose a suitable application method for an intrusion
   detection system, 2) suggest a bidirectional recurrent neural
   network-based anomaly detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based network,
   and 3) demonstrate the verification of the proposed technique using
   various power system-specific attack data, including real power system
   using CPS network traffic, CPS malware behavior (CMB), false data
   injection (FDI), and disabling reassembly (DR) attacks. Proposed
   technique successfully detected five types of CMB attacks, three types
   of FDI and DR attacks.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Pages = {{74933-74942}},
Abstract = {{With the development of the Cyber-Physical-Social Systems(CPSS), a large
   number of multidimensional time series have been generated in today \&
   x2019;s world, such as: sensor data for industrial equipment operation,
   vehicle driving data, and cloud server operation and maintenance data
   and so on. The key task of Cloud \& x2013;Fog \& x2013;Edge Computing in
   managing these systems is how to detect anomalous data in a specific
   time series to facilitate operator action to solve potential system
   problems. So multidimensional time series outlier detection become an
   important direction of CPSS data mining and Cloud \& x2013;Fog \&
   x2013;Edge Computing research, and it has a wide range of applications
   in industry, finance, medicine and other fields. This paper proposes a
   framework called Multidimensional time series Outlier detection based on
   a Time Convolutional Network AutoEncoder (MOTCN-AE), which can detect
   outliers in time series data, such as identifying equipment failures,
   dangerous driving behaviors of cars, etc. Specifically, this paper first
   uses a feature extraction method to transform the original time series
   into a feature-rich time series. Second, the proposed TCN-AE is used to
   reconstruct the feature-rich time series data, and the reconstruction
   error is used to calculate outlier scores. Finally, the MOTCN-AE
   framework is validated by multiple time series datasets to demonstrate
   its effectiveness in detecting time series outliers.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) can be defined by the
   integration of control, network communication, and computing with a
   physical manufacturing process. In this work, we present a hybrid model
   of CPMS combining sensor data, context information, and expert
   knowledge. We used the identification of global operational states and a
   multimodel framework to improve anomaly detection and diagnosis. The
   anomaly detection is based on context-sensitive adaptive threshold
   limits. Root cause diagnosis is based on classification models and
   expert knowledge. The proposed approach was implemented using the
   Internet of Things (IoT) to extract data from a computer numerical
   control machine. Results showed that using a context-sensitive modeling
   strategy allowed to combine physics-based and data-driven models for
   residual analysis to detect an anomaly in the part, machine, or process.
   The identification of root cause was improved by adding context
   information in classification models to identify worn or broken tools
   and wrong material. Note to Practitioners-Anomaly detection and
   diagnosis of manufacturing equipment is a complex problem. Some of the
   challenges are complex machine dynamics and nonstationary operating
   conditions. This paper describes a framework for modeling manufacturing
   equipment using a combination of sensor data, context information, and
   system knowledge. The proposed modeling framework is used to improve
   anomaly detection for diagnostics using a context-sensitive strategy.
   This work aims to support more effective maintenance actions by
   identifying problems in the machine, part, or process. The modeling and
   anomaly detection strategy was used to identify anomalies in computer
   numerical control machines and can be extended to other equipment on the
   plant floor.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) opens up several
   challenges regarding the assurance of high levels of reliability.
   Therefore, we need to develop a new data quality analysis and new CPS
   components/subsystems for the detection, isolation, recovery, and
   prevention of failures and intrusion events. Furthermore, we have to
   develop new reliability assessment models and metrics in order to
   properly evaluate CPSs. Agent technologies, through their
   characteristics such as autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and
   proactivity, have the potential to address these challenges and
   requirements. We propose a multi-agent based solution, namely ReliaCPS,
   for detecting and preventing the failures of the system components of
   CPSs. We also use a case study of a CPS for monitoring ambient
   parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Our
   results indicate improvements in terms of reliability metrics (32.69\%

   physical energy system for detection of dynamic attack}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICTs) introduce many
   Internet-based entry points that pose potential risks to cyber physical
   energy system (CPES). Therefore, it is significant to enhance the
   cybersecurity of CPES from cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new dynamic
   attack model that takes into account the dynamic characteristics of
   energy systems is developed based on traditional false data injection
   attack. The proposed attack model can be used to describe the attack
   behaviors of a malicious attacker over time. Then, we propose a new
   generalized interval state estimator to quantify the normal fluctuations
   of all CPES state variables. In this state estimator, the Unscented
   Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to predict the real-time operating level of
   the state variables. Copula theory is introduced to model the prediction
   uncertainty of sustainable energy and load as a set of conditional
   quantiles. We then model the normal fluctuation range of each CPES state
   as a bilevel nonlinear programming problem based on the worst case
   analysis. Consequently, an anomaly detection method is developed to
   detect whether there is an attack or not in the CPES. In this method,
   any state variable that falls outside its estimated interval is
   considered an abnormal point. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic
   attack model and the effectiveness of the anomaly detection method have
   been extensively validated on test systems in power and energy society

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease is one of the notable neurodegenerative disorders
   caused by insufficient production of dopamine which damages the motor
   skills and voice. Advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has
   fuelled the development of healthcare systems. In this article, we
   propose an intelligent system for detecting Parkinson's disease to
   provide proper medication by analysing voice samples. Instead of relying
   on limited storage capacity and computational resources of IoT, the
   recent healthcare systems take advantages of the cloud server. On the
   other hand, the utilization of cloud computing incurs the issues of data
   privacy and additional communication costs to the healthcare systems. To
   address this issue, we propose to utilize Fog computing as a midway
   layer between end devices and the cloud server. The proposed system
   employs the combinatorial Fuzzy K-nearest Neighbor and Case-based
   Reasoning classifier for the better classification of the Parkinson
   patients from healthy individuals. On the detection of abnormality, the
   proposed healthcare system is designed to generate an immediate alert to
   the patient. The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on the
   UCI-Parkinson dataset, and the results reveal the improved performance
   of our system over baseline approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding potential behaviors of attackers is of paramount
   importance for improving the cybersecurity of power systems. However,
   the attack behaviors in existing studies are often modeled statically on
   a single snapshot, which neglects the reality of a dynamically
   time-evolving power system. Accordingly, a dynamic cyber-attack model
   with local network information is proposed to characterize the typical
   data injection attack with the integration of potential dynamic
   behaviors of an attacker. The proposed model collaboratively alters the
   meter measurement in a stealthy way to illegally contaminate the system
   state, thus posing severe threats to cyber physical power systems. We
   then develop a novel anomaly detection countermeasure from the
   perspective of state estimation to effectively recognize the dynamic
   injection attack. In this countermeasure, an interval state forecasting
   method is proposed to approximate the possible largest variation bounds
   of each state variable based on a worst-case analysis considering the
   forecasting uncertainties of renewable energy sources, electric loads,
   and network parameter perturbations. In addition, the kernel quantile
   regression is introduced and implemented to formulate the uncertainties
   in renewable energy and electric load forecast as a series of confidence
   intervals. When any state variable falls outside its preforecasted
   intervals, the proposed countermeasure detects the anomaly and sets an
   alarm condition indicating the possibility of data contamination.
   Finally, the results from our extensive studies on several IEEE standard
   test systems have been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   dynamic attack and the effectiveness of the detection countermeasure.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) security has become a critical research
   topic as more and more CPS applications are making increasing impacts in
   diverse industrial sectors. Due to the tight interaction between cyber
   and physical components, CPS security requires a different strategy from
   the traditional information technology (IT) security. In this paper, we
   propose a machine learning-based attack detection (AD) scheme, as part
   of our overall CPS security strategies. The proposed scheme performs AD
   at the physical layer by modeling and monitoring physics or physical
   behavior of the physical asset or process. In developing the proposed AD
   scheme, we devote our efforts on intelligently deriving salient
   signatures or features out of the large number of noisy physical
   measurements by leveraging physical knowledge and using advanced machine
   learning techniques. Such derived features not only capture the physical
   relationships among the measurements but also have more discriminant
   power in distinguishing normal and attack activities. In our
   experimental study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
   AD scheme, we consider heavy-duty gas turbines of combined cycle power
   plants as the CPS application. Using the data from both the
   high-fidelity simulation and several real plants, we demonstrate that
   our proposed AD scheme is effective in early detection of attacks or
   malicious activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with secure state estimation of cyber-physical systems
   subject to switching (on/off) attack signals and injection of fake
   packets (via either packet substitution or insertion of extra packets).
   The random set paradigm is adopted in order to model, via random finite
   sets (RFSs), the switching nature of both system attacks and the
   injection of fake measurements. The problem of detecting an attack on
   the system and jointly estimating its state, possibly in the presence of
   fake measurements, is then formulated and solved in the Bayesian
   framework for systems with and without direct feedthrough of the attack
   input to the output. This leads to the analytical derivation of a hybrid
   Bernoulli filter (HBF) that updates in real time the joint posterior
   density of a Bernoulli attack RFS and of the state vector. A closed-form
   Gaussian mixture implementation of the proposed HBF is fully derived in
   the case of invertible direct feedthrough. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the developed tools for joint attack detection and secure state
   estimation is tested on two case studies concerning a benchmark system
   for unknown input estimation and a standard IEEE power network
   application.}},

Journal = {{SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{The Cypher Physical Power Systems (CPPS) became vital targets for
   intruders because of the large volume of high speed heterogeneous data
   provided from the Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS). The Nonnested
   Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate
   classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However,
   NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input
   features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders
   the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce
   VHDRA, a Vertical and Horizontal Data Reduction Approach, to improve the
   classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and reduce the
   computational resource consumption. VHDRA provides the following
   functionalities: (1) it vertically reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant features and by reducing the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles. (2) It horizontally reduces the size of data while
   preserving original key events and patterns within the datasets using an
   approach called STEM, State Tracking and Extraction Method. The
   experiments show that the overall performance of VHDRA using both the
   vertical and the horizontal reduction reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles
   by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves the accuracy of the NNGE
   by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\% using the Multi-, Binary, and Triple class
   datasets, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disaster is one of the most important research topics worldwide.
   In this paper, a data driven cyber-physical system is introduced to
   detect landslides. This system is composed of Wi-Sun acceleration
   sensors, which can detect the acceleration of the nearby environment in
   3D domain, and the sensors are linked with the router (act as `sink'
   node) via Wi-Sun transmission (i.e. IEEE802.15.4g). The details of the
   detection system are explained and the landslide detection mechanism
   with low computational complexity is proposed. A traffic reduction
   method is proposed thereafter to help reduce the data needed for
   transmission by exploring the intra-correlations of the sensor data.
   This method can save the energy consumption without degrading the
   detection performance. Field test is conducted and the results show that
   the landslide can be detected and amount of data to be transmitted can
   be reduced, which verifies the system's effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the security problems in cyber-physical systems (CPSs)
   against replay attack are considered. With replay attacks, attacker
   records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and
   receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective
   for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed
   to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and
   compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method
   detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in
   normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are
   further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and
   output, respectively. Moreover, the output-based detector has more
   low-computing solution process than the residual-based one. Finally, a
   practical example is proposed to demonstrate the superiority of the

Abstract = {{Industrial Cyber-Physical System (ICPS) monitoring is increasingly being
   used to make decisions that impact the operation of the industry.
   Industrial manufacturing environments such as production lines are
   dynamic and evolve over time due to new requirements (new customer
   needs, conformance to standards, maintenance, etc.) or due to the
   anomalies detected. When an evolution happens (e.g., new devices are
   introduced), monitoring systems must be aware of it in order to inform
   the user and to provide updated and reliable information. In this
   article, CALENDAR is presented, a software module for a monitoring
   system that addresses ICPS evolutions. The solution is based on a data
   metamodel that captures the structure of an ICPS in different
   timestamps. By comparing the data model in two subsequent timestamps,
   CALENDAR is able to detect and effectively classify the evolution of
   ICPSs at runtime to finally generate alerts about the detected
   evolution. In order to evaluate CALENDAR with different ICPS topologies
   (e.g., different ICPS sizes), a scalability test was performed
   considering the information captured from the production lines domain.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a next-generation intelligent system
   integrating computing, communication, and control. As a unit of
   computing process and physical process, CPS is a new research field,
   where cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is not only a microcosm
   of CPS but also a prerequisite for unmanned systems. CACC relies on the
   wireless communication network technology to achieve cooperative
   platooning control through vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative control
   methods. It can improve traffic efficiency and ensure safe driving. Once
   the wireless network is introduced by each vehicle to exchange
   information, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks, making attack detection
   necessary. In this paper, an integral sliding mode observer is designed
   to monitor malicious attacks. The proposed sliding mode observer not
   only retains the performance of traditional sliding mode control but
   also realizes the finite-time observation, avoiding the singular
   phenomenon that may occur in the traditional terminal sliding mode.

Abstract = {{In the harsh environmental conditions of cyber-physical systems (CPSs),
   the consensus problem seems to be one of the central topics that affect
   the performance of consensus-based applications, such as events
   detection, estimation, tracking, blockchain, etc. In this paper, we
   investigate the events detection based on consensus problem of CPS by
   means of compressed sensing (CS) for applications such as attack
   detection, industrial process monitoring, automatic alert system, and
   prediction for potentially dangerous events in CPS. The edge devices in
   a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local
   observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to
   iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The
   information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of
   jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus
   algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal
   decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region
   and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors.
   Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster
   partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network
   lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a
   global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm
   can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower
   transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The electric power system infrastructure has begun to adopt digital
   information technologies such as transmission control protocol/internet
   protocol (TCP/IP) and Ethernet infrastructures. With this adoption,
   information technology-centric network and system management (NSM) tools
   are used to manage the intermediate communication systems and electric
   devices in digital substations. However, the technology to monitor the
   cyber-physical System (CPS) statistics for the intelligent electronic
   devices (IEDs) and serial communication for a digital substation does
   not exist yet. In this paper, we aim to propose cyber-physical analysis
   methodologies of a digital substation system, concerning issues of (1)
   International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62351-7 based network
   and system management, (2) behavior analysis of the CPS, (3)
   cyber-physical anomaly detection systems, and (4) a testbed for a
   digital substation. By collaborating with Electric Power Research
   Institute (EPRI), a cyber security testbed for the digital substation
   has been developed to implement the use cases and analyze potential
   security threats. Newly integrated methodologies for information
   handling are expected to lead to improved safety and reliability for the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a frequency-based approach for the detection of
   replay attacks affecting cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular,
   the method employs a sinusoidal signal with a time-varying frequency
   (authentication signal) into the closed-loop system and checks whether
   the time profile of the frequency components in the output signal are
   compatible with the authentication signal or not. In order to carry out
   this target, the couplings between inputs and outputs are eliminated
   using a dynamic decoupling technique based on vector fitting. In this
   way, a signature introduced on a specific input channel will affect only
   the output that is selected to be associated with that input, which is a
   property that can be exploited to determine which channels are being
   affected. A bank of band-pass filters is used to generate signals whose
   energies can be compared to reconstruct an estimation of the
   time-varying frequency profile. By matching the known frequency profile
   with its estimation, the detector can provide the information about
   whether a replay attack is being carried out or not. The design of the
   signal generator and the detector are thoroughly discussed, and an
   example based on a quadruple-tank process is used to show the
   application and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{Cyber Physical System (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry
   4.0. CPS is an integrated system that combines computing, sensors and
   actuators. CPS is controlled by computer-based algorithms that
   integrates people and internet. However, the performance of CPS is
   limited by its computational complexity. How to implement CPS with less
   computational complexity in a real time performance remains an important
   issue. Therefore, the study attempts to establish a CPS based on machine
   learning to reduce its complexity and improve applicability. This study
   applies a Fault Detection and Classification system (FDC) with machine
   learning method in the virtual subsystem of CPS. This study consists of
   two steps. Based on the data collected from sensors of CPS, Random
   Forest (RF) is used to figure out key factors that reduces the data
   dimension for less computational complexity. The process engineers will
   know which factors are causing the machine fails. The second step is to
   establish a time series model which bases on Long Short-Term Memory
   (LSTM) network to achieve real time monitoring of the machine. Before
   the machine fails, FDC will alarm that allow the engineer to adjust
   parameters of machines to avoid machine fails. The study in order to
   achieve the goals of predicting machines fails, figuring out key
   factors, predicting maintenance and increasing the productivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effect of replay attacks on constrained
   cyber-physical systems which are subject to linear probabilistic
   constraints. In order to inject an exogenous control input without being
   detected the attacker will hijack the sensors, observe and record their
   readings for a certain amount of time and repeat them afterwards while
   carrying out his attack. The conditions under which the attacker can
   induce perturbation in the control loop without being detected is
   studied. Then, in order to make the system resilient to the replay
   attack, a random signal (serving as the authentication signal) is added
   to the control input. Since this signal can hamper the performance of
   the system, finally, the optimization of the authentication signals is
   proposed to maximize the detection rate while keeping the process
   deterioration bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is
   demonstrated on a simulated case study.}},

Abstract = {{In most of our daily lives, we observe repetitive (periodic) movements
   of our surrounding objects. In physiotherapy, for example, during the
   physical exercises, the analysis of the periodicity in the patient's
   performance would help to evaluate and monitor the his recovery process.
   Cyber Physical Systems for smart environments have great potential in
   providing context-aware, automated support in everyday life of people
   that need adaptive occupational therapy. We present a method and
   program-based algorithm for the detection and analysis of periodic
   activities of subjects performing physical exercises from video
   sequences. The algorithm detects the beginning of a series of exercises
   of a given type, measures the duration of each of them, detects the end
   of the sequence and measures the number of repetitions. Experimental
   results with publicly available video dataset will prove the
   applicability of the proposed method for detection of repetitive

Abstract = {{These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as
   power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures
   are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects
   anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is
   especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because
   the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can
   execute illegal operations within the normal network communication
   defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend
   to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work,
   we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that
   estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with
   the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The
   proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication
   to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state.
   We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and
   confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support
   vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection
   rules.}},

Abstract = {{A cyber-physical system consists of sensors, microcontroller, networks,
   and actuators that interact with each other, generate a substantial
   amount of data, and form extremely complex system operational profiles.
   These heterogeneous components are subject to errors, e.g. spikes,
   off-sets, or delays, that may result in system failures. As the
   complexity of modern systems increases, it becomes a challenge to apply
   traditional fault detection and isolation methods to such complex
   systems.
   Deep learning based methods have surpassed traditional methods in terms
   of performance as the data size and complexity increase. The signals of
   cyber-physical systems are mainly time-series data. In this paper, we
   propose a new on-line error detection and mitigation approach for common
   sensor, computing hardware, and network errors of cyber-physical systems
   using deep learning based methods. More specifically, we train a Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a single step prediction model for
   the detection and mitigation of errors, like spikes, or offsets. In
   order to detect the long-duration errors that show no sharp change (a
   sudden drop or rise) between two successive data samples when errors
   occurred, e.g. network delays, we train an LSTM encoder-decoder as a
   multi-step prediction model. We also introduce the on-line error
   mitigation approach. Automatic recovery is achieved by replacing the
   detected errors with the predicted values. Finally, we demonstrate
   on-line error detection and mitigation capabilities of the trained
   single step and multistep predictors using representative case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The security of cyber physical systems such as autonomous vehicle
   platoons plays a vital role in ensuring passenger safety. An adversary
   in control of a single vehicle can degrade platoon efficiency or even
   cause collisions. In this paper, we focus on detecting an attack meant
   to destabilize a platoon, thereby causing collisions, and identifying
   the source of the attack (i.e., the vehicle under control of the
   adversary) using Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCDNN) and
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The vehicles in the platoon are
   assumed to be equipped with sensors (LIDAR and RADAR) that measure the
   range and relative speed of their immediate neighbors. These sensor
   data, modelled with noise following a Gaussian distribution, are used to
   train a FCDNN and CNN for attack detection and identification. The
   effectiveness of these networks are tested for different scenarios based
   on local and global sensor information availability. The initial study
   show that for a ten vehicle platoon, CNN detects and identifies an
   attack with highest accuracy of 97.5\%, just by using the own local
   sensor information. We also show that the range measurements provide
   better accuracy in comparison to the velocity measurements. The platoon
   is modelled and simulated in MATLAB and neural networks are generated
   and tested using Tensorflow and Keras deep learning libraries.}},

   infrastructure now. A prominent family of CPSs are networked control
   systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over

   networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we
   design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on
   system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error
   statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system
   operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it
   significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating
   controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic
   controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on
   a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal
   amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that
   the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator
   is also successful in alleviating the attack effects.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the detection problems of
   controller-to-actuator replay attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs).
   The replay attacks on controller-to-actuator channels can influence the
   dynamic property and even stability. For the detection task, we employ a
   pseudo-random signal to code those communication channels, and
   code-decode abnormalities are generated when replay attacks occur. The
   abnormalities can be modeled as an additional Gaussian signal in system
   dynamic. Then, an anomaly detector is designed with a new type, which
   combines the pseudorandom signal covariance, to detect the abnormalities
   caused by replay attack and pseudo-random code. As a result, we obtain
   an optimization problem to solve the threshold value of detector and the
   covariance of code signal. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the above conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The networking of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a worldwide trend.
   With the growing accessibility of data vulnerability to attacks
   increases. Recent cyber attacks like Triton point out the necessity of
   new methods to secure CPS. Despite multiple dissimilarities between CPS
   and a general IT system, the mature field of IT security can inspire new
   methods for the protection of CPS such as cryptography. The encryption
   of signals transferring through the network is not new. The homomorphic
   encryption scheme allows execution of mathematical operations in the
   encrypted domain. This allows to encrypt not only signals in the network
   but also parameters and variables of a remote monitoring system. In this
   way, it is much more difficult for the adversary to gather information
   about the plant to execute a stealthy attack. In this paper, a somewhat
   homomorphic encryption scheme is applied to a CPS to ensure safe and
   secure communication by protecting all signals and variables in the
   network without loss of performance. A numerical example demonstrates
   the security level that can he achieved by applying this scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic state estimation, enabled by phasor measurement units (PMUs),
   opens new opportunities to improve detection of cyber-physical attacks
   in power networks. Distributed approaches to estimation and attack
   detection have many advantages, such as reduced processing times and
   increased security, and are arguably necessary for large size networks.
   In this work, we present a fully-distributed dynamic state estimation
   algorithm using PMU measurement data. The dynamic state estimation is
   jointly designed with an innovation-based attack detection scheme to
   limit communication overhead. An attractive feature of our work is that
   each control area utilizes a local model of reduced dimension. The
   design of our algorithm uses an approximation to the state covariance
   matrix, which allows for a trade-off between computation, communication,
   and accuracy. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness
   of this approach.}},

Title = {{BRIoT: Behavior Rune Specification-Based Misbehavior Detection for
   IoT-Embedded Cyber-Physical Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Abstract = {{The identification of vulnerabilities in a mission-critical system is
   one of the challenges faced by a cyber-physical system (CPS). The
   incorporation of embedded Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it
   tedious to identify vulnerability and difficult to control the
   service-interruptions and manage the operations losses. Rule-based
   mechanisms have been considered as a solution in the past. However,
   rule-based solutions operate on the goodwill of the generated rules and
   perform assumption-based detection. Such a solution often is far from
   the actual realization of the IoT runtime performance and can be fooled
   by zero-day attacks. Thus, this paper takes this issue as motivation and
   proposes better lightweight behavior rule specification-based
   misbehavior detection for the IoT-embedded cyber-physical systems
   (BRIoT). The key concept of our approach is to model a system with which
   misbehavior of an IoT device manifested as a result of attacks
   exploiting the vulnerability exposed may be detected through automatic
   model checking and formal verification, regardless of whether the attack
   is known or unknown. Automatic model checking and formal verification
   are achieved through a 2-layer Fuzzy-based hierarchical context-aware
   aspect-oriented Petri net (HCAPN) model, while effective misbehavior
   detection to avoid false alarms is achieved through a
   Barycentric-coordinated-based center of mass calculation method. The
   proposed approach is verified by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   embedded in a UAV system. The feasibility of the proposed model is
   demonstrated with high reliability, low operational cost, low
   false-positives, low false-negatives, and high true positives in
   comparison with existing rule-based solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-modalities are ideal for user authentication in Medical
   Cyber-Physical Systems. Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the
   face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user
   authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been
   developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection
   systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some
   of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the
   bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained,
   heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors.
   Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor
   management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software
   client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable
   communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis.
   Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect
   bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS. In this regard, we propose a
   machine learning based security algorithm run as an application at the
   fog node using a binarized multi-factor boosted ensemble learner
   algorithm coupled with feature selection. Our proposal is verified on
   real datasets provided by the Replay Attack, Warsaw and LiveDet 2015
   Crossmatch benchmark for face, iris and fingerprint modality spoofing
   detection used for authentication in an MCPS. The experimental analysis
   shows that our approach achieves significant performance gain over the
   state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are growing with added complexity and
   functionality. Multidisciplinary interactions with physical systems are
   the major keys to CPS. However, sensors, actuators, controllers, and
   wireless communications are prone to attacks that compromise the system.
   Machine learning models have been utilized in controllers of automotive
   to learn, estimate, and provide the required intelligence in the control
   process. However, their estimation is also vulnerable to the attacks
   from physical or cyber domains. They have shown unreliable predictions
   against unknown biases resulted from the modeling. In this paper, we
   propose a novel control design using conditional generative adversarial
   networks that will enable a self-secured controller to capture the
   normal behavior of the control loop and the physical system, detect the
   anomaly, and recover from them. We experimented our novel control design
   on a self-secured BMS by driving a Nissan Leaf S on standard driving
   cycles while under various attacks. The performance of the design has
   been compared to the state-of-the-art; the self-secured BMS could detect
   the attacks with 83\% accuracy and the recovery estimation error of 21\%
   on average, which have improved by 28\% and 8\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging smart grid, cyber-physical infrastructure, provides a
   steady, secure, and reliable power system over the current power grid.
   Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key
   element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure
   time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast
   sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and
   data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120
   samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher
   data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a
   challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this
   paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning
   techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying
   system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this
   paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the
   RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic
   synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data
   concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the
   algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm has been tested in real-time
   using an OPAL-RT digital real-time simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Operational Technology (OT) often refers to the industrial control
   systems which are used to monitor and control the devices and processes
   of critical infrastructure like, water treatment plant, power grid and
   sewage systems. Conventionally, these OT systems are completely isolated
   from Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to protect their
   processes and devices against cyber-attacks. However, the convergence of
   IT and OT is inevitable to improvise the remote management of physical
   devices and to enhance the production by incorporating data-driven
   decision making by accessing and analyzing their real-time data. To
   achieve this, the isolated OT systems and devices need to be accessed
   using Internet. However, this interconnection leads both the sensor and
   control data of OT systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This research
   work extends our previous intrusion detection system that identifies
   anomalies which are deviated from process-invariants in secured water
   treatment (SWaT) test-bed data obtained from Singapore University of
   Technology and Design (SUTD). Additionally, it proposes
   process-invariants based timed automata wherein the attack and its
   detection model are represented as timed automata. The proposed system
   is implemented and validated using UPPAAL, a tool for validating
   real-time systems represented as networks of timed automata. The results
   conclude that the proposed system effectively identifies the attacks
   considered thereby recommending the timed automata as an operational
   tool for detecting the data-integrity attacks in critical
   infrastructures. The highly reported attacks that include level
   indicators, motorized valves, pressure indicators and analyzer
   indicators are detected successfully by the proposed system. Using the
   results, Stage 1 and Stage 3 are highly vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor localization has become popular in recent years due to the
   increasing need of location-based services in mobile cyber-physical
   systems (CPS). The massive deployment of light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   further promotes the indoor localization using visual light. As a key
   enabling technique for mobile CPS, accurate indoor localization based on
   visual light communication remains nontrivial due to various
   non-idealities such as attenuation induced by unexpected obstacles. The
   anomalies of localization can potentially reduce the dependability of
   location-based services. In this article, we develop a novel indoor
   localization framework based on relative received signal strength. Most
   importantly, an efficient method is derived from the triangle inequality
   to automatically detect the abnormal LED lamps that are blocked by
   obstacles. These LED lamps are then ignored by our localization
   algorithm so that they do not bias the localization results, which
   improves the dependability of our localization framework. As
   demonstrated by the simulation results, the proposed techniques can
   achieve superior accuracy over the conventional approaches, especially
   when there exist abnormal LED lamps.}},

Abstract = {{The violation of data integrity in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems
   (CPS) may lead to dangerous situations for drivers and pedestrians in
   terms of safety. In particular, cyber-attacks on the sensor could easily
   degrade data accuracy and consistency over any other attack, we
   investigate attack detection and identification based on a deep learning
   technology on wheel speed sensors of automotive CPS. For faster recovery
   of a physical system with detection of the cyber-attacks, estimation of
   a specific value is conducted to substitute false data. To the best of
   our knowledge, there has not been a case of joining sensor attack
   detection and vehicle speed estimation in existing literature. In this
   work, we design a novel method to combine attack detection and
   identification, vehicle speed estimation of wheel speed sensors to
   improve the safety of CPS even under the attacks. First, we define
   states of the sensors based on the cases of attacks that can occur in
   the sensors. Second, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is applied to detect
   and identify wheel speed sensor attacks. Third, in order to estimate the
   vehicle speeds accurately, we employ Weighted Average (WA), as one of
   the fusion algorithms, in order to assign a different weight to each
   sensor. Since environment uncertainty while driving has an impact on
   different characteristics of vehicles and causes performance
   degradation, the recovery mechanism needs the ability adaptive to
   changing environments. Therefore, we estimate the vehicle speeds after
   assigning a different weight to each sensor depending on driving
   situations classified by analyzing driving data. Experiments including
   training, validation, and test are carried out with actual measurements
   obtained while driving on the real road. In case of the fault detection
   and identification, classification accuracy is evaluated. Mean Squared
   Error (MSE) is calculated to verify that the speed is estimated
   accurately. The classification accuracy about test additive attack data
   is 99.4978\%. MSE of our proposed speed estimation algorithm is 1.7786.
   It is about 0.2 lower than MSEs of other algorithms. We demonstrate that
   our system maintains data integrity well and is safe relatively in
   comparison with systems which apply other algorithms.}},

Title = {{On-Device AI-Based Cognitive Detection of Bio-Modality Spoofing in
   Medical Cyber Physical System}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Pages = {{2126-2137}},
Abstract = {{Bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, and fingerprint, are ideal for
   establishing authentication in the futuristic networks, such as the
   medical cyber physical systems (MCPSs). In such a network, to
   authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be
   traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they
   are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not
   only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the
   data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving
   on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification
   problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real
   bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device
   AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a
   light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the
   feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of
   random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation
   mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed
   approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the
   network as cloud computation and communication is removed. Our proposal
   is verified on real datasets of the face, iris, and fingerprint
   bio-modalities provided by the Warsaw, Replay-Attack, and LiveDet 2015
   Crossmatch benchmark, respectively. The experimental results show that
   our model can outperform the state-of-the-art architectures in four out
   of six tests. Besides, we show that the FA-RF can significantly reduce
   the training and testing time in both the cloud and the on-device AI
   node.}},

Abstract = {{Smart water infrastructures are prone to cyber-physical attacks that can
   disrupt their operations or damage their assets. An algorithm was
   developed to identify suspicious behaviors in the different
   cyber-physical components of a smart water distribution system. The
   algorithm incorporated multiple modules of anomaly-detection techniques
   to recognize different types of anomalies in the real-time monitoring
   and control data. Trained artificial neural networks were used to detect
   unusual patterns that do not conform to normal operational behavior.
   Principal component analysis was conducted to decompose the
   high-dimensional space occupied by the sensory data to uncover global
   anomalies. The algorithm was trained using a historical data set of
   trusted observations and tested against a validation and a test data
   set, both featuring a group of simulated attack scenarios. The proposed
   approach successfully identified all the attacks featured in the Battle
   of the Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL) data sets with high
   sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, the performance was sensitive
   to high background noise in the sensory data. (C) 2018 American Society

Abstract = {{Two novel luminescent cadmium coordination polymers (Cd-CPs),
   {[}Cd(TPA)(DIB)](n) (1) and {[}Cd(TPA)(BIYB)](n) (2), have been
   successfully designed and synthesized using Cd2+, deprotonated
   3,3'-thiodipropionic acid (H(2)TPA), and 4,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)
   biphenyl (BIYB) or 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl) benzene (DIB). CP 1 has a 3D
   structure with a new topology. CP 2 possesses a double layer 2D
   structure with two types of 1D tunnel. The fluorescence property
   application and mechanisms of the two Cd-CPs for detecting Hg2+,
   Cr2O72-, nitrobenzene (NB), or 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) have been
   researched. CPs 1-2 demonstrate good chemical stability, high
   sensitivity and selective responsive detection of Hg2+, Cr2O72-, NB, or
   2,4-DNP. The high quenching percentages in dilute aqueous solutions were
   98.5\% (Hg2+, 1), 96.2\% (Hg2+, 2), 98.5\% (Cr2O72-, 1), 96.4\%
   (Cr2O72-, 2), 99.6\% (NB, 1) and 99.2\% (2,4-DNP, 2). The detection
   limits were 2.1 x 10(-7) (Hg2+, 1), 1.1 x 10(-6) (Cr2O72-, 1), 2.7 x
   10(-7) (NB, 1), 1.9 x 10(-7) (Hg2+, 2), 2.4 x 10(-7) (Cr2O72-, 2), and
   1.3 x 10(-7) (2,4-DNP, 2) and are similar to the permissible limits set
   by the USEPA. The mechanism of Hg2+ luminescence quenching involves an
   interaction with the free thio sites of the CPs. The Cr2O72-, NB, and
   2,4-DNP quenching mechanism involves the overlap of the absorption bands
   of the recognition materials with the excitation or emission bands of
   CPs 1-2. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best examples of
   CPs as probes for sensing Hg2+, Cr2O72-, NB, or 2,4-DNP.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a new engineering paradigm, which
   combine the cyber and physical world with comprehensive computational
   and analytical tools to solve complex tasks. In cyber-physical systems,
   components are developed to detect failures, prevent failures, or
   mitigate the failures of a system. Sensors gather real-time data as an
   input to the system for further processing. Therefore, the whole
   cyber-physical system depends on sensors to accomplish their tasks and
   the failure of one sensor may lead to the failure of the whole system.
   To address this issue, we present an approach that utilizes the Failure
   Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis, which is a prominent hazard
   analysis technique to increase the understanding of risk and failure
   prevention. In our approach, we transform the Failure Modes, Effects,
   and Criticality Analysis model into a UML(Unified Modeling Language)
   class diagram, and then a knowledge base is constructed based on the
   derived UML class diagram. Finally, the UML class diagram is used to
   build an ontology. The proposed approach employs a 5C architecture for
   smart industries for its systematic application. Lastly, we use a smart

Title = {{Adaptive Threshold Generation for Fault Detection with High
   Dependability for Cyber-Physical Systems}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPS) applied to safety-critical or
   mission-critical domains require high dependability including safety,
   security, and reliability. However, the safety of CPS can be
   significantly threatened by increased security vulnerabilities and the
   lack of flexibility in accepting various normal environments or
   conditions. To enhance safety and security in CPS, a common and
   cost-effective strategy is to employ the model-based detection
   technique; however, detecting faults in practice is challenging due to
   model and environment uncertainties. In this paper, we present a novel
   generation method of the adaptive threshold required for providing
   dependability for the model-based fault detection system. In particular,
   we focus on statistical and information theoretic analysis to consider
   the model and environment uncertainties, and non-linear programming to
   determine an adaptive threshold as an equilibrium point in terms of
   adaptability and sensitivity. To do this, we assess the normality of the
   data obtained from real sensors, define performance measures
   representing the system requirements, and formulate the optimal
   threshold problem. In addition, in order to efficiently exploit the
   adaptive thresholds, we design the storage so that it is added to the
   basic structure of the model-based detection system. By executing the
   performance evaluation with various fault scenarios by varying
   intensities, duration and types of faults injected, we prove that the
   proposed method is well designed to cope with uncertainties. In
   particular, against noise faults, the proposed method shows nearly 100\%
   accuracy, recall, and precision at each of the operation, regardless of
   the intensity and duration of faults. Under the constant faults, it
   achieves the accuracy from 85.4\% to 100\%, the recall of 100\% from the
   lowest 54.2\%, and the precision of 100\%. It also gives the accuracy of
   100\% from the lowest 83.2\%, the recall of 100\% from the lowest
   43.8\%, and the precision of 100\% against random faults. These results
   indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly better
   performance than existing dynamic threshold methods. Consequently, an
   extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method
   is able to accurately and reliably detect the faults and achieve high
   levels of adaptability and sensitivity, compared with other dynamic
   thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{The recent increase in frequency and severity of cyber-physical attacks
   on water treatment plants and distribution systems calls for the
   development of intrusion detection schemes that help protect these
   critical infrastructures. This paper contributes an algorithm
   specifically designed for detecting and localizing cyber attacks against
   water distribution systems. The algorithm builds on the idea of learning
   a data-driven model that reproduces the patterns of all hydraulic
   processes observed within a distribution system: the model is trained
   using data pertaining to normal operating conditions, in order to poorly
   reproduce anomalous patterns, such as those induced by cyber attacks.
   The modeling process is carried out using autoencoders, a deep learning
   neural network architecture capable of building a compressed and
   meaningful representation of high-dimensional input data patterns. The
   algorithm is developed and tested on three data sets devised for the
   Battle of the Attack Detection Algorithmsthe only open-source data
   available, at this stage, for research in cyber security of water
   networks. Results show that the detection algorithm can identify all
   attacks featured in the data sets, including those compromising data
   integrity. The algorithm has two additional important features: it
   localizes the components under attack, and it is developed using only
   data pertaining to normal operating conditions, which are generally
   available to water utilities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a general event-triggered framework is constructed to
   investigate the problem of remote fault detection for stochastic
   cyber-physical systems subject to the additive disturbances, sensor
   nonlinearities and deception attacks. Both fault-detection residual
   generation and evaluation module are fully described. Two energy norm
   indices are presented so that the fault-detection residual has the best
   sensitivity to faults and the best robustness to unwanted factors
   including additive disturbances and false information injected by
   attacker. Moreover, the filter gain and residual weighting matrix are
   formulated in terms of stochastic Lyapunov function, which can be
   conveniently solved via standard numerical software. Finally, an
   application example is presented to verify the performance of fault
   detection by comparative simulations. The prolonged battery life is
   experimentally evaluated and analyzed via a wireless node platform.}},

   cyber attacks, which are modeled as jamming signals injected to the
   network, a likelihood ratio based (LRB) scheduler is designed in the
   sensor to smartly select informative sensor measurements for
   transmission. We show that even under a moderate transmission rate
   constraint of secure networks, an optimal LRB scheduler can achieve a
   comparable asymptotic detection performance to the standard
   Neyman-Pearson test using the full set of measurements, and is strictly
   better than the random scheduler. For nonsecure networks, the LRB
   scheduler can also maintain the detection functionality but suffers
   graceful performance degradation under different attack intensities.
   Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks to Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are detected by Industrial
   Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs). Operation of stage-based CPSs
   (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three
   parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and
   normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art
   IIDSs directly ad-dress cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states
   whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate
   cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to
   detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically
   extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS
   behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field
   layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to
   illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three
   cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process
   indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O
   CPSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a set-theoretic method for the detection of data

   is extracted and is used as a set-induced anomaly detector. If the state
   vector exits the invariant set, then an alarm will be activated, and the
   potential threat is considered disclosed. The attack scenario used to
   assess the efficiency of the proposed anomaly detector concerns
   corrupted frequency sensor measurements transmitted to the automatic

   studies highlight the ability of a set-theoretic approach to disclose
   persistent and intermittent attack patterns even when they occur at the

Abstract = {{This paper studies an attacker against a cyber-physical system (CPS)
   whose goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while
   ensuring that his or her probability of being detected does not exceed a
   given bound. The attacker's probability of being detected is related to
   the non-negative bias induced by his or her attack on the CPS's
   detection statistic. We formulate a linear quadratic cost function that
   captures the attacker's control goal and establish constraints on the
   induced bias that reflect the attacker's detection-avoidance objectives.
   When the attacker is constrained to be detected at the false alarm rate
   of the detector, we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a
   linear feedback of the attacker's state estimate. In the case that the
   attacker's bias is upper bounded by a positive constant, we provide two
   algorithms-an optimal algorithm and a suboptimal, less computationally
   intensive algorithm-to find suitable attack sequences. Finally, we
   illustrate our attack strategies in numerical examples based on a
   remotely controlled helicopter under attack.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) are often controlled by
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and
   Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) which manage their operation and
   maintain a reliable water supply. As such, and with the cyber layer
   becoming a central component of WDS operations, these systems are at a
   greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks. This paper offers a
   model-based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of
   WDSs combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification
   of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically
   based rules alone. The results show that the proposed algorithm is
   capable of achieving the best-known performance when tested on the data

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Detection errors such as false alarms and undetected faults are
   inevitable in any practical anomaly detection system. These errors can
   create potentially significant problems in the underlying application.
   In particular, false alarms can result in performing unnecessary
   recovery actions while missed detections can result in failing to
   perform recovery which can lead to severe consequences. In this paper,
   we present an approach for application-aware anomaly detection (AAAD).
   Our approach takes an existing anomaly detector and configures it to
   minimize the impact of detection errors. The configuration of the
   detectors is chosen so that application performance in the presence of
   detection errors is as close as possible to the performance that could
   have been obtained if there were no detection errors. We evaluate our
   result using a case study of real-time control of traffic signals, and
   show that the approach outperforms significantly several baseline
   detectors.}},

Abstract = {{The use of control-theoretic solutions to detect attacks against
   cyber-physical industrial systems is a growing area of research.
   Traditional literature proposes the use of control strategies to retain,
   eg, satisfactory close-loop performance, as well as safety properties,
   when a communication network connects the distributed components of a
   physical system (eg, sensors, actuators, and controllers). However, the
   adaptation of these strategies to handle security incidents is an
   ongoing challenge. In this paper, we survey the advantages of a
   watermark-based detector against some integrity attacks as well as the
   weaknesses against other attacks. To cover these weaknesses, we propose
   a new control and security strategy that complements the watermark-based
   detector. We validate the detection efficiency of the new strategy via
   numeric simulation. Experimental results are also presented by using a
   laboratory testbed based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   industrial protocols.}},

   model invalidation approach}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{476-488}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for
   cyber-physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models
   with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach
   builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a
   set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input-output data is
   compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this
   set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved
   efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the
   second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the
   concept of T-detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault
   models satisfies T-detectability property for a finite T, this allows
   the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon
   manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the
   concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed
   approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture
   language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of
   the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart
   building radiant systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber Physical System(CPS) allows to collect different sensor and alarm
   data from large number of facilities in industrial plants. Failure and
   faulty diagnosis is one of the most complicated and dynamic problems in
   the industrial plant management since most of failures are extremely
   ambiguous which needs to be solved based on an expert's experience. This
   makes the solutions very subjective and requires too much time, efforts
   and monetary investment. In this paper, we are proposing new failure
   detection approach with machine learning and human expertise by using
   alarm data. As the first step of developing this new method, we
   collected several types of alarm data that detected functional failure
   in Hyundai Steel factory. We analyzed and processed the alarm data with
   35 domain experts. Based on the data, we propose a knowledge based
   system which is Ripple Down Rule-based. This system acquires knowledge
   by machine learning which is maintained by human experts. The evaluation
   results showed that the proposed failure detection framework can reduce
   the time of human expertise acquisition and the cost of solving
   over-generalization and over-fitting problems by using machine learning
   techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   integrity issue with price manipulation attack, we propose a Cumulative
   Sum (CUSUM) algorithm that detects this attack even with granular price
   changes; (ii) Secondly, the availability issue with Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack against which we develop an efficient method to monitor and
   detect any misbehaving node. Performance evaluations show the robustness
   of the proposed IDS system compared to existing mechanisms. The achieved
   detection rate is above 95\% and the false positive rate is below 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the detection and compensation co-design
   issue for cyber-physical systems against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
   First, a novel supervisory strategy is proposed based on the concept of
   packet reception rate, which can detect the behavior of a DoS attacker
   during a given time window. A quantitative description of the
   relationship among attack times, time window, attack success rate and
   packet reception rate is analyzed. Based on the attack detection
   information, the current state under attack can be successfully
   reconstructed by some past available states. Then, a co-design
   compensation mechanism is also obtained, which can further guarantee the
   attacked system is stochastically stable (without the zero-mean Gaussian
   white noise) or mean square exponentially ultimately bounded (with the
   zero-mean Gaussian white noise). The corresponding design conditions are
   derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical
   example and a practical example are given to show the effectiveness and
   superiority of the presented design method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A developing trend of traditional industrial systems is the integration
   of the cyber and physical domain to improve flexibility and the
   efficiency of supervision, management, and control. But, the deep
   integration of these industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs),
   increases the potential for security threats. Attack detection, which
   forms initial protective barrier, plays an important role in overall
   security protection. However, most traditional methods focused on cyber
   information and ignored any limitations that might arise from the
   characteristics of the physical domain. In this paper, an anomaly
   detection approach based on zone partition is designed for ICPSs. In
   detail, initially an automated zone partition method, ensuring crucial
   system states can be observed in more than one zone, is designed. Then,
   methods of building zone function model, which do not require any prior
   knowledge of the physical system are presented before analyzing the
   anomaly based on zone information. Finally, an experimental rig is
   constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   results demonstrate that the approach presents a high-accuracy solution,
   which also performs effectively in real time.}},

Abstract = {{The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are the central research topic in the
   era of Industrial 4.0. Such systems interact intensively between
   physical entities and abstract information, and commonly exist in the
   industrial processes and people's daily lives. This paper investigates
   the practical difficulties of the vehicular CPSs online implementation,
   and based on that proposes a fault diagnosis and control architecture
   with modular units and reserved extendibility. It is elaborated that the
   systems' adaptability could be enhanced by either the online tracking
   techniques or the ensemble learning schemes. For the onboard deployment
   of automobile CPSs, the requirement of real-time capacity is in focus. A
   new recursive total principle component regression based design and
   implementation approach is proposed for efficient data-driven fault
   detection. Simulation tests were carried out on the Carsim to compare
   the proposed approach with multiple existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of joint distributed attack
   detection and distributed secure estimation for a networked
   cyber-physical system under physical and cyber attacks. The system is
   monitored by a wireless sensor network, in which a group of sensors is
   spatially distributed and the sensors' measurements are broadcast to
   remote estimators via a wireless network medium. A malicious adversary
   simultaneously launches a false data injection attack at the physical
   system layer to intentionally modify the system's state and jamming
   attacks at the cyber layer to block the wireless transmission channels
   between sensors and remote estimators. The sensors' measurements can be
   randomly dropped with mathematical probability if the corresponding
   transmission channels are deliberately jammed by the adversary.
   Resilient attack detection estimators are delicately constructed to
   provide locally reliable state estimations and detect the false data
   injection attack. Then, criteria for analyzing the estimation
   performance and designing the desired estimators are derived to
   guarantee the solvability of the problem. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach is shown through an illustrative example.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems have recently emerged in several practical
   engineering applications where security and privacy are of paramount
   importance. This motivated the paper and a recent surge of interest in
   development of innovative and novel anomaly and intrusion detection
   technologies. This paper proposes a novel distributed blind intrusion
   detection framework by modeling sensor measurements as the target
   graph-signal and utilizing the statistical properties of the
   graph-signal for intrusion detection. To fully take into account the
   underlying network structure, the graph similarity matrix is constructed
   using both the data measured by the sensors and sensors' proximity
   resulting in a data-adaptive and structure-aware monitoring solution. In
   the proposed supervised detection framework, the magnitude of the
   captured data is modeled by Gaussian Markov random field and the
   corresponding precision matrix is estimated by learning a graph
   Laplacian matrix from sensor measurements adaptively. The proposed
   intrusion detectionmethodology is designed based on a modified Bayesian
   likelihood ratio test and the closed-form expressions are derived for
   the test statistic. Finally, temporal analysis of the network behavior
   is established by computing the Bhattacharyya distance between
   themeasurement distributions at the consecutive time instants.
   Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method and to compare it with that of the state-of-the-art methods. The
   results show that the proposed intrusion detection framework provides a
   detection performance superior to those provided by the other existing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are today ubiquitous in urban
   environments. Such systems now serve as the backbone to numerous
   critical infrastructure applications, from smart grids to IoT
   installations. Scalable and seamless operation of such CPSs requires
   sophisticated tools for monitoring the time series progression of the
   system, dynamically tracking relationships, and issuing alerts about
   anomalies to operators. We present an online monitoring system (illiad)
   that models the state of the CPS as a function of its relationships
   between constituent components, using a combination of model-based and
   data-driven strategies. In addition to accurate inference for state
   estimation and anomaly tracking, illiad also exploits the underlying
   network structure of the CPS (wired or wireless) for state estimation
   purposes. We demonstrate the application of illiad to two diverse
   settings: a wireless sensor motes application and an IEEE 33-bus
   microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of attack detection in cyber-physical systems is considered

   effectiveness of the transfer entropy countermeasures in attack
   detection is evaluated via theoretical analysis, numerical
   demonstrations, as well as comparative simulations with classical chi(2)
   detectors. Four types of attacks are considered: denial-of-service,

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which are an integration of computation,
   networking, and physical processes, play an increasingly important role
   in critical infrastructure, government and everyday life. Due to
   physical constraints, embedded computers and networks may give rise to
   some additional security vulnerabilities, which results in losses of
   enormous economy benefits or disorder of social life. As a result, it is
   of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to
   ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper,
   from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent
   advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs.
   First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for
   the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of
   cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and
   deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective.
   Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are
   discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The
   development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed
   according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the
   security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally,
   some challenge issues are raised for the future research. (c) 2017

Abstract = {{Today cyber-physical systems are becoming more and more popular with the
   industry 4.0. Given the size and criticality of the systems they are
   used, it is very important that the cyber physical systems work
   properly. In this study, image-processing based anomaly movement
   detection method, which can be integrated to systems anytime, is
   proposed. With detection of anomaly movements and preventing unexpected
   situations, the cost arises from hitches, breakdowns or damaged
   productions is reduced. This study consists of two main section, first
   is implementing remote-controlled simple industrial robot system, second
   is the detection of unwanted movements and controlling the system.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women today.
   Hence early detection of breast cancer is a challenging task. The paper
   involves the proposed method for breast cancer detection using imaging
   techniques such as mammography and thermography. The computer aided
   diagnosis tool is used as an efficient method to segment and classify
   the digital images. The data accessing for clinicians is difficult to
   due limited medical care in rural areas. Cyber-physical system (CPS)
   relates the virtual and physical world. CPS aids in integrating network,
   interacting between human and system, provides high flexibility,
   scalability and optimization. In medical field, CPS is used to attain a
   high quality healthcare. It has become a full-fledged system in breast
   cancer detection and performs all the process from patient's data
   acquisition till the decision making. It offers high safety for the
   patients by reducing errors and continuous monitoring of the data.}},

   paper. The models of three-tank system and the cyber attacks will be
   firstly introduced. Then, we use particle filter to estimate the state
   of the three-tank system which is subjected to the cyber attacks.
   According to the estimation result, a residual is designed based on
   sliding-time window technique in order to detect the attacks. Finally, a
   simulation experiment is designed to illustrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Cyber attacks on cyber-physical systems bring new challenges to existing
   methods of fault detection and fault tolerant estimation. In this paper,
   an approach is proposed for the secure state estimation in
   cyber-physical systems with switching attacks. The attack signal causes
   a switch in the system behaviour. We consider only two system modes,
   nominal mode and attacked mode. As the switching sequence is unknown,
   information coming from IT cybersecurity layer is used to guide the
   switching signal of the observer mode. The residual signal provided by
   the switched observer also influences the switching signal of the
   observer. The stability of the resulting estimation error dynamics is
   proven. An example is given to illustrate the advantage of the proposed
   approach over two other switching observer schemes.}},

Abstract = {{While the ever-increasing connectivity of cyber-physical systems
   enlarges their attack surface, existing anomaly detection frameworks
   often do not incorporate the rising heterogeneity of involved systems.
   Existing frameworks focus on a single fieldbus protocol or require more
   detailed knowledge of the cyber-physical system itself. Thus, we
   introduce a uniform method and framework for applying anomaly detection
   to a variety of fieldbus protocols. We use stacked denoising
   autoencoders to derive a feature learning and packet classification
   method in one step. As the approach is based on the raw byte stream of
   the network traffic, neither specific protocols nor detailed knowledge
   of the application is needed. Additionally, we pay attention on creating
   an efficient framework which can also handle the increased amount of
   communication in cyber-physical systems.
   Our evaluation on a Secure Water Treatment dataset using EtherNet/IP and
   a Modbus dataset shows that we can acquire network packets up to 100
   times faster than packet parsing based methods. However, we still
   achieve precision and recall metrics for longer lasting attacks of over
   99\%.}},

Title = {{A BP Neural Network-Based Communication Blind Signal Detection Method
   With Cyber-Physical-Social Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{43920-43935}},
Abstract = {{The development of wireless communication technologies will lead to an
   increase of rapid-time-variants featured occasions and physical
   occasions of small-data-size communication in network, and the
   modulation system diversification resulting from social group
   densification. Though traditional blind signal detection approaches have
   been improved by reducing their excessive reliance on data size, they
   still have the defects of various postulated conditions in new settings,
   complicated computation, unstable detection effect and high error rate.
   This paper aims to explore a communication blind signal detection method
   in the setting of cyber-physical-social systems in the field of
   back-propagation (BP) neural network. First, a BP neural network is used
   as the equalizer, an error function is redefined, and the
   back-propagation algorithm is used to train and adjust blind signal data
   deviation and to update network weight rules for adaptation to network
   settings with rapid time-variants. Second, a double-sigmoid BP neural
   network excitation function is constructed to improve poor multiple
   information processing and network performances resulting from social
   group densification. Third, self-adaptive variable step size for
   physical devices power is constructed to adjust the conflict between
   convergence rate and steady-state error caused by different powers with
   the increase of small-data-size communication. Finally, an output vector
   is made to be closest to an expected vector; thereby, blind signal
   detection rate of social groups communication using physical devices in
   the cyber environment can be improved. The experiments show that the
   communication blind signal detection method proposed in the paper
   improves signal detection precision, and reduces omission rate (below
   2\%). Besides, the method is characterized by minor error, removes
   deficiencies of traditional methods for blind signal extraction, and can
   effectively accomplish blind signal detection.}},

Title = {{Cyber Physical System for Stroke Detection}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{37444-37453}},
Abstract = {{Stroke is one of the fatal diseases that affect the brain and causes
   death within 3 to 10 h. However, most of the deaths caused by a stroke
   can be avoided with the identification of the nature of stroke and react
   to it in a timely manner by intelligent health systems. The
   state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) enable interaction between
   physical and computational world to identify any anomaly in the physical
   world and respond to it. The response of CPS may vary depending upon the
   context of the physical world. Extensive research has been done in this
   area from the perspective of wireless sensor networks, body area
   networks, and wearable smart devices. This paper proposes a CPS for
   detecting the occurrence of stroke in patients, who have a high risk of
   stroke or have survived a stroke before. The developed CPS sends
   recorded data to the doctor and alerts him when the stroke occurs. The
   proposed system is operating on data acquired from
   electroencephalography sensors from patients' brain. This article aimed
   at decreasing human mortality rate due to stroke and will bridge the
   gaps in CPS due to interdisciplinary isolation. The disciplines involved
   in the development of a CPS include communication networks, pattern
   recognition, software engineering, mathematics, and biomedical.}},

   Diseases}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{34834-34845}},
Abstract = {{Paroxysmal diseases of inpatients are globally recognized as one of the
   top challenges in medicine. Poor clinical outcomes are primarily caused
   by delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnostic
   criteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and already
   overloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuring
   devices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physical
   characterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains to
   provide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physical
   system (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnoses
   of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medical
   knowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model to
   characterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiency
   between physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-based
   medical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integrate
   medical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from the
   heavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decision
   support. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases.
   Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstrate
   that we enable early detection in 11.02\% more patients and detect the
   condition 16.57 hours earlier on average.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a major concern in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).
   In this paper, an algorithm based on Petri Net (PN) is proposed that

   that the use of distributed and multidisciplinary intrusion detection
   methods in different layers of CPSs increases security of the net
   against coordinated cyber-attacks. Simulation results and comparative

Abstract = {{In this paper, secure, remote estimation of a linear time-varying
   Gaussian process via observations at multiple sensors is considered.
   Such a framework is relevant to many cyberphysical systems and
   internet-of-things applications. Sensors make sequential measurements
   that are shared with a fusion center; the fusion center applies a form
   of optimal filtering to make its estimates. The challenge is the
   presence of malicious sensors which can inject anomalous observations to
   skew the estimates at the fusion center. The set of malicious sensors
   may be time-varying. The problems of malicious sensor detection and
   secure estimation are considered. First, a novel detector to detect
   injection attack on an unknown sensor subset is developed. Next, an
   algorithm for secure estimation is proposed. The proposed estimation
   scheme uses a novel filtering and learning algorithm, where an optimal
   filter is learnt over time by using the sensor observations in order to
   filter out malicious sensor observations while retaining other sensor
   measurements. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of incorporating context in medical
   cyber-physical systems (MCPS) applications for the purpose of improving
   the performance of MCPS detectors. In particular, in many applications
   additional data could be used to conclude that actual measurements might
   be noisy or wrong (e.g., machine settings might indicate that the
   machine is improperly attached to the patient); we call such data
   context. The first contribution of this work is the formal definition of
   context, namely additional information whose presence is associated with
   a change in the measurement model (e.g., higher variance). Given this
   formulation, we developed the contextaware parameter-invariant (CA-PAIN)
   detector; the CA-PAIN detector improves upon the original PAIN detector
   by recognizing events with noisy measurements and not raising
   unnecessary false alarms. We evaluate the CA-PAIN detector both in
   simulation and on real-patient data; in both cases, the CA-PAIN detector
   achieves roughly a 20-percent reduction of false alarm rates over the
   PAIN detector, thus indicating that formalizing context and using it in
   a rigorous way is a promising direction for future work.}},

Abstract = {{An attack detection scheme is proposed to detect data integrity attacks
   on sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). A combined fingerprint for
   sensor and process noise is created during the normal operation of the
   system. Under sensor spoofing attack, noise pattern deviates from the
   fingerprinted pattern enabling the proposed scheme to detect attacks. To
   extract the noise (difference between expected and observed value) a
   representative model of the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used
   for the purpose of state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates
   from the real system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown
   that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and
   sensor noise. A set of time domain and frequency domain features is
   extracted from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine
   learning algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are
   performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility
   and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm attacks,
   designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by the proposed
   scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely
   identified with accuracy higher than 90\% based on the noise
   fingerprint.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure the proper functioning of critical systems, it is important to
   design secure Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Since CPS are connected
   systems, most studies consider external adversaries as a threat model,
   which might not be able to cater for an insider threat with the physical
   access to the system. In this article, we proposed an attack detection
   mechanism for an insider who has physical access to a CPS. The proposed
   method exploits the dynamics of the system and detects an attack based
   on the laws of Physics. Based on the mass flow equations, we analyze the
   rate of change in the plant's process and create a feature vector based
   on the process dynamics. The model has been trained by passing rate of
   change in system's state as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM), to
   detect the abnormal behavior in the system. Based on the proposed
   framework, experiments are performed on a real water treatment testbed,
   to validate our model and to measure the efficiency of the plant in
   normal and under attack scenarios. The detection result shows that
   proposed scheme can detect attacks with accuracy as high as 96\%.}},

   includes a method for performing vulnerability analysis, several methods
   for attack detection, and guidelines for conducting experimental studies
   in the context of cyber security. The method for vulnerability analysis
   makes use of the Failure-Attack-CounTermeasure (FACT) graph. The
   experimental study to evaluate methods for attack detection comprises of
   three experiments. These methods have been implemented and evaluated,
   within and across all three experiments, with respect to their
   effectiveness, detection speed, and durability for injection, scaling,
   and stealthy attacks. The proposed guidelines define key phases and

Abstract = {{With the increasingly widespread application of information and
   communication technology, the smart grid has gradually evolved into a
   cyber physical system characterised by deep integration between the
   information space and physical space. All manner of intrusion attacks on
   cyber physical power systems are growing more and more frequent. Timely
   and accurate detection and identification of these intrusions are
   essential for the effective control and protection of cyber physical
   power systems. For massive and high-dimensional intrusion behaviour data
   in cyber physical power systems, distributed intrusion detection based
   on hybrid gene expression programming and cloud (DID-HGEPCloud)
   computing is proposed. In the DID-HGEPCloud, attribution reduction with
   noise data based on rough set and a global intrusion model based on
   non-linear least squares are applied to improve the efficiency and
   accuracy of intrusion detection. At the same time, the MapReduce
   programming framework of cloud computing is adopted, and parallelisation
   of the model of the proposed algorithm is performed to enhance its
   ability to manage massive and high-dimensional data. Comparative
   experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious
   advantages in terms of false attack rate, DAR, and average time
   consumed. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm possesses excellent
   parallel performance.}},

Abstract = {{False data injection (FDI) attacks are crucial security threats to smart
   grid cyber-physical system (CPS), and could result in cataclysmic
   consequences to the entire power system. However, due to the high
   dependence on open information networking, countering FDI attacks is
   challenging in smart grid CPS. Most existing solutions are based on
   state estimation (SE) at the highly centralized control center; thus,
   computationally expensive. In addition, these solutions generally do not
   provide a high level of security assurance, as evidenced by recent work
   that smart FDI attackers with knowledge of system configurations can
   easily circumvent conventional SE-based false data detection mechanisms.
   In this paper, in order to address these challenges, a novel distributed
   host-based collaborative detection method is proposed. Specifically, in
   our approach, we use a conjunctive rule based majority voting algorithm
   to collaboratively detect false measurement data inserted by compromised
   phas or measurement units (PMUs). In addition, an innovative reputation
   system with an adaptive reputation updating algorithm is also designed
   to evaluate the overall running status of PMUs, by which FDI attacks can
   be distinctly observed. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted
   with real-time measurement data obtained from the Power World simulator,
   and the numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In cyber-physical system (CPS) over IEEE 802.11e-based wireless local
   area networks (WLANs), a misbehaving node can gain significant advantage
   over other normal nodes in terms of resource sharing by deliberately
   manipulating its protocol parameters. Due to the random spectrum-access
   nature of the protocol, it is challenging to detect the misbehaving node
   accurately and in real-time. Moreover, many existing misbehavior
   detectors, primarily designed for traditional IEEE 802.11 networks,
   become inapplicable in IEEE 802.11e networks with heterogeneous network
   configurations. In this paper, we propose novel real-time and
   light-weight countermeasures including a hybrid-share misbehavior
   detector and a packet-dropping-based misbehavior mitigation mechanism
   for IEEE 802.11e-based CPS. We develop mathematical models for the
   performance of the proposed detector and mitigation mechanisms.
   Extensive simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms can
   achieve a high detection rate and punish a misbehaving node with a high
   packet dropping rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an ontology-based language, OntoEvent, for
   semantic complex event modeling and detection in Cyber-Physical Systems

   general concepts and domain-specific instances, to promise it can be
   dynamic extended for different CPS application domains. Complex events
   are modeled based on event ontology with logical and temporal operators,
   and these operators are extended by nature language synonymies.
   OntoEvent language is of rich expressiveness compared to other
   traditional languages. Based on OntoEvent, We propose an event detection
   model and elaborate its construction procedures. Experimental results
   prove that OntoEvent-based event detection model outperforms other
   selected models in processing efficiency, especially when processing
   multiple complex event ontologies.}},

Abstract = {{From electricity distribution to water management, higher levels of
   efficiency and performance have been attained by the synergy of
   computers, communications, and control. This higher level of
   performance, however, comes at a cost to system security. Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS) have intrinsic vulnerabilities that malicious agents can
   explore in order to harm the integrity of the system. An attacker
   employing deception-based methods seeks to have their target believe an
   incorrect version of reality. This paper describes two anomaly detection
   approaches using, respectively, micro-level and process-level techniques
   which are then combined into one cross-level hypothesis test. The
   process-level (also referred as macro-level) detector uses the physical
   interconnections that exist between the multiple sensors and implements
   a consensus algorithm to determine if one sensor is reporting anomalous
   values. The micro-level detector uses measurements of the integrated
   circuit power supply current draw sampling several times per clock cycle
   to determine if the code running inside the micro-controller of a sensor
   has been altered. One example of a sensor-based deception attack the
   present work focuses on is a simple replay attack launched from one
   sensor within the system that aims to mislead controllers while eluding
   conventional fault detectors. The theoretical performance of the
   proposed method is evaluated in two laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are process control systems interacting
   with the cyber world. Once connected to the internet, they become prone
   to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the
   data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have
   financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved.
   Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper
   proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System
   through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The
   proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model.
   Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base
   will be first trained using simulated data of the system including
   faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained,
   real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the
   predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge
   base using comparator to detect anomalies. On detection of abnormal
   data, they will then be further identified as faults or attacks.}},

   role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the
   automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous
   sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing
   information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might
   cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine
   learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of
   sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as
   cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an
   intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on
   Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a
   prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in
   time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement
   Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and
   nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks
   category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then
   systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep
   learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed
   method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned
   ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our
   method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including
   the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously
   attacked.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) which can be defined by the integration of
   a physical process with network communication and computing is a key
   concept for smart manufacturing. Analysis of complex machines as CPS can
   support anomaly detection and diagnosis by providing the required data
   to model different operational conditions. In this work, we develop a
   hybrid model of manufacturing machines to estimate operational state
   based on machine functionality, dynamics, and interactions. We used the
   identification of a Global Operational State (GOS) to help partition,
   provide context to signals, and monitor the time of sub-tasks in a
   manufacturing process. Partitioning a signal based on GOS can improve
   anomaly detection and diagnosis. Monitoring duration of sub-tasks in the
   process can provide a detailed insight of cycle time and improve
   productivity analysis. The proposed approach was implemented using data
   from an automotive assembly plant to detect backlash and parts slipping
   in a conveyor system by monitoring energy signature and state variables.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating
   cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time
   state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian
   noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on
   both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce
   particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To
   solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection
   and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual
   generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first
   generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using
   statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The
   proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several
   attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its
   statistical performance is also compared with several conventional
   quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the
   transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed
   criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed
   detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and
   false isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential data generated from various sources in a multi-mode
   industrial production system provides valuable information on the
   current mode of the system and enables one to build a model for each
   individual operating mode. Using these models in a multi-mode system,
   one may distinguish modes of the system and, furthermore, detect whether
   the current mode is a (normal or faulty) mode known from historical
   data, or a new mode. In this work, we model each individual mode by a
   probabilistic suffix tree (PST) used to implement variable order Markov
   models (VOMMs) and propose a novel unsupervised PST matching algorithm
   that compares the tree models by a matching cost once they are
   constructed. The matching cost we define comprises of a subsequence
   dissimilarity cost and a probability cost. Our tree matching method
   enables to compare two PSTs in linear time by one concurrent top-down
   pass. We use this matching cost as a similarity measure for k-medoid
   clustering and cluster PSTs obtained from system modes according to
   their matching costs. The overall approach yields promising results for
   unsupervised identification of modes on data obtained from of a physical
   factory demonstrator. Notably we can distinguish modes on two levels of
   granularity, both corresponding to human expert labels, with a RAND
   score of up to 73 \% compared to a baseline of at most 42 \%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design and implementation of a vibration fault
   detection cyber-physical system (VFDCPS) is presented. Vibration fault
   detection is increasingly used in track vibration, bridge vibration and
   other related fields. However, current research reveals some problems
   such as low accuracy of fault detection, few effective in-depth
   calculation of vibration data and fault test methods. Cyber-Physical
   systems (CPSs) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical
   processes. From the CPSs point of view, VFDCPS consists of three layers:
   the monitoring and control layer (MCL), the network layer and the device
   layer. The MCL deals with real-time monitoring and the precise control
   of the system. In the network layer, the CANopen network of field device
   can communicate with the Ethernet of VFDCPS for system's expandability
   and reliability. The device layer copes with collected data by using
   fast Fourier transform (FFT), lowpass filter, etc., which greatly
   improves the system's accuracy and the ability of massive computing.
   This paper also proposes a fault detection algorithm with vibration data
   called Spider which quantifies the criteria of fault evaluation. It is
   shown by test data that our approaches and improvements in design make
   VFDCPS more accurate and reliable in real-time vibration fault
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems are found in industrial and production systems,
   as well as critical infrastructures. Due to the increasing integration
   of IP-based technology and standard computing devices, the threat of
   cyber-attacks on cyber-physical systems has vastly increased.
   Furthermore, traditional intrusion defense strategies for IT systems are
   often not applicable in operational environments. In this paper we
   present an anomaly-based approach for detection and classification of
   attacks in cyber-physical systems. To test our approach, we set up a
   test environment with sensors, actuators and controllers widely used in
   industry, thus, providing system data as close as possible to reality.
   First, anomaly detection is used to define a model of normal system
   behavior by calculating outlier scores from normal system operations.
   This valid behavior model is then compared with new data in order to
   detect anomalies. Further, we trained an attack model, based on
   supervised attacks against the test setup, using the naive Bayes
   classifier. If an anomaly is detected, the classification process tries
   to classify the anomaly by applying the attack model and calculating
   prediction confidences for trained classes. To evaluate the statistical
   performance of our approach, we tested the model by applying an
   unlabeled dataset, which contains valid and anomalous data. The results
   show that this approach was able to detect and classify such attacks
   with satisfactory accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems - systems that incorporate physical devices with
   cyber components - are appearing in diverse applications, and due to
   advances in data acquisition, are accompanied with large amounts of
   data. The interplay between the cyber and the physical components leaves
   such systems vulnerable to faults and intrusions, motivating the
   development of a general model that can efficiently and continuously
   monitor a cyber-physical system. To be of practical value, the model
   should be adaptive and equipped with the ability to detect changes in
   the system. This paper makes three contributions: (1) a new adaptive
   modeling framework for monitoring an arbitrary cyber-physical system in
   real-time using a flexible statistical distribution called the
   normal-gamma; (2) a novel streaming validation procedure, demonstrated
   on data streams from a cyber-physical system at Los Alamos National

Abstract = {{Securing cyber-physical systems is vital for our modern society since
   they are widely used in critical infrastructure like power grid control
   and water distribution. One of the most sophisticated attacks on these
   systems is the covert attack, where an attacker changes the system
   inputs and disguises his influence on the system outputs by changing
   them accordingly. In this paper an approach to detect such an attack by
   extending the original system with a switched auxiliary system is
   proposed. Furthermore, a detection system using a switched Luenberger
   observer is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   illustrated by a simulation example.}},

Abstract = {{Within the frame of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as
   Industry 4.0, industrial cyber-physical production systems (ICPS) have
   experienced a significant progress. To this end, Industry 4.0 has
   brought upon an improved, flexible, and cost-efficient system
   architecture that can sustain the development of innovative applications
   and services. Nonetheless, this technological advancement also exposed
   ICPS to significant cyber threats. This paper contributes to the
   development of a cross-layer anomaly detection system (ADS) for ICPS by
   defining a lightweight detection methodology that leverages
   Dempster-Shafer's ``Theory of Evidence{''} in order to: infer the
   system's state; fuse evidence from a wide range of monitored parameters;
   and deliver a comprehensive and scalable detection system. The proposed
   approach is validated in the context of a real natural gas

Abstract = {{Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex
   system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important
   because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable
   environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a
   precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging
   task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection
   method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium
   management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method
   by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers
   with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers
   indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected
   failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to
   the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of
   functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method
   did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition,
   our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of
   operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding
   anomalies, but there is still room for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are being widely deployed in
   security-critical scenarios such as smart homes and medical devices.
   Unfortunately, the connectedness of these systems and their relative
   lack of security measures makes them ripe targets for attacks.
   Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to
   be effective for securing CPSs. Unfortunately, deriving invariants for
   capturing the specifications of CPS systems is a tedious and error-prone
   process. Therefore, it is important to dynamically monitor the CPS
   system to learn its common behaviors and formulate invariants for
   detecting security attacks. Existing techniques for invariant mining
   only incorporate data and events, but not time. However, time is central
   to most CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data
   and events, is essential for achieving low false positives and false
   negatives.
   This paper proposes ARTINALI, which mines dynamic system properties by
   incorporating time as a first-class property of the system. We build
   ARTINALI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for two CPSes, namely
   smart meters and smart medical devices, and measure their efficacy. We
   find that the ARTINALI-based IDSes significantly reduce the ratio of
   false positives and false negatives by 16 to 48\% (average 30.75\%) and
   89 to 95\% (average 93.4\%) respectively over other dynamic invariant
   detection tools.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the potential of deep learning for real-time
   detection of cyber-physical attacks on water distribution systems. Deep
   learning methods represent the state-of-the-art of artificial
   intelligence, and they have been successfully employed for solving
   classification and regression problems in many fields of engineering. We
   focus on AutoEncoders (AE), which are multi-layered artificial neural
   networks trained to reconstruct their own inputs. During the training
   process, the weights of the AE are tuned to minimize the reconstruction
   error computed for all training patterns. This entails that when used on
   new input data, anomalous patterns containing outliers are coarsely
   reproduced by the AE-with a corresponding higher reconstruction error.
   When employed for attack detection on water distribution systems, the AE
   are trained to map the status of the network by using the readings of
   the deployed sensors as both inputs and outputs of the model. If the
   training data are representative of normal operations, the AE return
   high reconstruction errors when fed with sensor readings recorded during
   the course of an attack. The detection performance is evaluated on a
   test dataset featuring several classes of plausible attacks-simulated
   with EPANET-and quantified with two evaluation criteria accounting for
   detection accuracy, false alarms and the time needed to identify a
   threat. We also carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect
   of data availability and model complexity on AE detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{Automated monitoring and operation of modern Water Distribution Systems
   (WDSs) are largely dependent on an interconnected network of computers,
   sensors, and actuators that are jointly coordinated by a Supervisory
   Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Although the implementation
   of such embedded systems enhances the reliability of the WDS, it also
   exposes it to cyber-physical attacks that can disrupt the system's
   operation or compromise critical information. Hence, the development of
   attack detection algorithms that can efficiently diagnose and identify
   such assaults is crucial for the successful application of these
   automated systems. In this study, we developed an algorithm to identify
   anomalous behaviors of the different components of a WDS in the context
   of the Battle of the Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL). The
   algorithm relies on using multiple layers of anomaly detection
   techniques to identify both local anomalies that affect each sensor
   individually, as well as global anomalies that simultaneously affect
   more than one sensor at the same time. The first layer targets finding
   statistical outliers in the data using simple outlier detection
   techniques. The second layer employs a trained artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) model to detect contextual anomalies that does not
   conform to the normal operational behavior of the system. The third
   layer uses principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the
   high-dimensional space occupied by the given set of sensor measurements
   into two sub-spaces representing normal and anomalous network operating
   conditions. By continuously tracking the projections of the data
   instances on the anomalous conditions subspace, the algorithm identifies
   the outliers based on their influence on the directions of the principal
   components. The proposed approach successfully predicted all of the
   pre-labeled attacks in the validation data set with high sensitivity and
   specificity. However, for all the detected attacks, the algorithm
   maintained a false `` under attack{''} status for a few hours after the
   threat no longer existed.}},

   cross-association, and optimal IDS design. To this end, phase 1 embraces
   sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive variables to specific
   interventions (e.g., control signals and cyber attacks), phase 2 adopts
   the cross-association assessment to optimally structure the process
   variables in groups that are the most sensitive to groups of
   interventions, and finally, phase 3 optimally assigns the most sensitive
   process variables to IDS, while enforcing the IDS capacity limitations
   and redundancy requirements. Numerical results on a realistic vinyl
   acetate monomer process show that the approach can reduce the number of
   variables by 76.8\%, thus reducing the complexity and the costs of the
   detection infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of seven methods for detecting stealthy attacks on Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPS) was investigated using an experimental study. The
   Amigobot robot was used as the CPS. The experiments were conducted in
   simulation as well as on the physical robot. Three types of stealthy
   attacks were implemented: surge, bias, and geometric. Two variations of
   Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method for detecting attacks were evaluated:
   partial and full physics. Four attack scenarios were implemented.
   Results from the experiments indicate that stealthy attacks could remain
   undetected by the CUSUM methods for some attack scenarios. In addition
   to the CUSUM-based methods, a set of five methods to complement CUSUM
   were implemented and their effectiveness assessed. While the additional
   methods do improve the effectiveness of CUSUM-based methods, some
   attacks remained undetected regardless of which method, or a combination
   of methods, was used for detection due to the amount of variation in
   sensor measurements between different runs in simulation and in the
   physical robot.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid infrastructure is an integration of advanced communication,
   sensing and computing techniques into the existing physical electrical
   grid. It is emerging as a critical cyber-physical system (CPS)
   infrastructure. CPS comes across as systems with a tight integration
   between the physical and the cyber layers in addition to the
   communication network. This exposes it to a risk of mis-operation when
   subjected to false or malicious data injection from intruders or
   adversaries. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a data
   analytics based cyber defense strategy of a substation automation system
   (SAS) by developing an intelligent module which uses Support vector
   machine (SVM) along with Principal component analysis (PCA). We propose
   a two stage approach for detecting the false data injection by an
   intruder into the system. First stage reduces the high dimensional
   dataset to a lower dimension using PCA and the second stage uses SVM on
   the reduced dataset for detecting the malicious attempts of introducing
   false data into the system. The proposed module uses the measurement
   values received from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Upon receiving
   a fault signal, the protection system initiates checks on incoming data
   patterns and compares it with the behavior of system dynamics. Using
   data analytics tools the fault condition signaling is classified as
   actual (real) fault or false (fake) fault with malicious intentions. The
   proposed methodology is demonstrated on three bus power network.}},

Abstract = {{In security standards, operation log of Cyber Physical System (CPS)
   should be periodically reviewed to uncover those attacks that were not
   detected by Industrial Intrusion Detection System (IIDS). In this
   review, security experts may find some attack samples; however this
   manual process is not practical considering the large number of samples
   in log. In addition, in sophisticated cyber-attacks such as Stuxnet
   worm, determining normal samples with high confidence can be
   complicated. Hence, a semi-supervised dataset with only some positive
   samples (attacks) is available. In this paper, a statistical method for
   detecting attacks in such datasets is proposed. To the best of our
   knowledge, this work is the first try on detecting attacks in semi
   supervised datasets in industrial settings. This method, which is called
   SADCPS, assumes that attack samples are significantly different from
   normal ones in several features. These features are identified by
   Welch's statistical t-test. Each discriminative feature decides whether
   a sample is attack or not. Then for each sample, weighted voting is
   performed on the results of discriminative features and attack index is
   calculated. Thus, security experts instead of searching all samples,
   only inspect samples with higher attack indexes. For evaluations, a milk
   pasteurization process with almost 50 I/Os (features) were simulated and
   its normal operation and operation under attack were logged for several
   periods. Results indicated that given only few attacks, SADCPS assigns
   most of the first ranks (higher attack indexes) to attack samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with cyber-physical attack detection problem in
   networked control systems subject to limited communication bandwidth.
   This constraint arises when an attack detection system is located at a
   remote site and so the required signals, measurement output and control
   signals, need to be transmitted over a digital communication channel.
   Therefore, data before being sent to the remote site must be encoded and
   converted from analog signals to digital signals by using quantizer. A
   quantizer maps the amount of information from a continuous space to a
   finite set which is compatible with the limited communication bandwidth.
   Considering the quantized measurement output, a detection algorithm by
   means of a set-membership filtering approach will be proposed. The
   algorithm consists of a prediction ellipsoid set and an estimation
   ellipsoid set updated with the quantized measurement output. The
   detection method depends on the existence of intersection between two
   sets computed by the filter. Simulation results for some possible
   physical and cyber attacks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum industry has started to embrace the advanced Petroleum
   Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technologies. Offshore petroleum CPS is
   particularly difficult to build, mainly due to the challenge in
   detecting and preventing offshore oil leaking. During the oil

   technology is typically used for leak detection, enabling the underwater
   modeling of an offshore petroleum CPS. However, such a technology
   suffers from insufficient remote sensing resources and large
   computational overhead. In this work, a cross entropy optimization based
   leak detection technique is proposed to detect the oil leak, which also
   facilitates the understanding of the oil leak induced marine pollution.
   Experimental results on a real Penglai oil spill event demonstrate that
   the proposed technique can effectively identify the sources of oil

Abstract = {{Advancement in sensing and networking technology enhances the capability
   of mechatronic systems by many folds and improves the way it interacts
   with its physical environment. However, the dependency on network
   technology introduces a new set of challenges. Vehicular cyber-physical
   system (VCPS) is one such example that came into existence with the
   objective of enhancing road safety and convenience. In VCPS, the safety
   applications rely on the correctness of the kinematics information
   received from other vehicles in the vicinity. Incorrect kinematics
   information may result in increase in road hazards and creates more
   confusion than convenience. Irrespective of the reasons, detection of
   such errant nodes in VCPS is imperative. Moreover, the trust estimation
   of the nodes can play an important role to classify them as genuine and
   errant. In this work, an efficient scheme is proposed for trust
   estimation and detection of those errant nodes that disseminate
   incorrect kinematics information in VCPS. Simulations using ns-2 and
   VanetMobiSim under realistic vehicular network environment are conducted
   to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results are
   encouraging and reveal that the proposed scheme is suitable for
   implementation in real vehicular environment for detection of such
   errant nodes with high accuracy. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Embedded Systems (CPESs) are distributed embedded systems
   integrated with various actuators and sensors. When it comes to the
   issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of
   Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the
   security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has
   become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power,
   storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for
   wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile,
   ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in
   industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these
   problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID)
   techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect
   malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence
   of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to
   achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing
   detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems
   (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In
   addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium
   and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can
   both reduce energy consumption by up to 50\% compared with the existing
   All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10\% to
   15\% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.}},

Abstract = {{In the hierarchical control paradigm of a smart grid cyber-physical
   system, decentralized local agents (LAs) can potentially be compromised
   by opportunistic attackers to manipulate electricity prices for illicit
   financial gains. In this paper, to address such opportunistic attacks,
   we propose a Dirichlet-based detection scheme, where a Dirichlet-based
   probabilistic model is built to assess the reputation levels of LAs.
   Initial reputation levels of the LAs are first trained using the
   proposed model, based on their historical operating observations. An
   adaptive detection algorithm with reputation incentive mechanism is then
   employed to detect opportunistic attackers. We demonstrate the utility
   of our proposed scheme using data collected from the IEEE 39-bus power
   system with the PowerWorld simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Timely and automatic detection and reconstruction of cyber attack is
   crucial in maintaining safe operation of cyber-physical systems. This
   study investigates the problem of unexpected cyber attack and its
   automatic recovery. First, detectability of attacks based on linear
   system theory is explored and some sufficient conditions of detecting
   state attacks and sensor attacks, respectively, are established.
   Subsequently two adaptive sliding mode observers with on line parameter
   estimation are designed to estimate state attacks and sensor attacks
   separately. Second, appropriate residual signals are constructed and it
   is shown that they approach to the attacks with ultimately uniformly
   bounded errors. Finally, as an illustration of attack detection and
   reconstruction, the results are applied to an IEEE 39 bus power system
   with 10 generators and 39 buses, which shows the effectiveness of the
   proposed adaptive schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is proving to be a
   useful tool for characterization and quantification of metallic
   nanoparticles. However, the short (200-400 mu s) transient signals
   generated by single particle events have to date presented challenges to
   current instrumentation and methodologies. Minimum dwell times are
   available commercially at 50-100 mu s timings but limitations in
   sensitivity for quadrupole ICP-MS make analysis of particles below 10 nm
   diameter difficult. A further limitation of ICPMS when using smaller
   dwell times is the available dynamic range. Typically, a simultaneous
   detector, as used with most ICP-MS has a maximum count ceiling of
   similar to 3 x 10(6) cps which equates to only 150 counts for a 50 mu s
   dwell. This work will present data acquired on a magnetic sector ICP-MS
   with GHz ppm(-1) sensitivities using dwell times down to 10 mu s and
   requiring no hardware modifications. This work will demonstrate the
   advantages obtained with the ability to measure fast transient signals
   with count rates in excess of 3 x 10(7) cps. A further range extension
   facility based on physical attenuation of the ion beam will be
   demonstrated which allows the same faster dwell times to be used for
   signals in excess of 1 x 10(9) cps. A novel data processing technique
   will be described, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous
   techniques when fixed particle signal widths and compliance with ideal
   Poisson statistics for error correction have been assumed. Data will be
   presented to show the non-ideal behaviour of ion cloud signals from
   nano-particles and the measurable impact of these behaviours on the
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Chemosensors have attracted increasing attention for their usefulness
   on-site detection and monitoring. In this study, we elucidated a novel,
   facile, and highly selective Chemo-Paper-Sensor (CPS) for detection and
   monitoring of strontium (Sr2+) ions, which means a potent colorimetric
   sensor based on a Chrysoidine G (CG)-coated paper strip. The CPS for
   highly selective colorimetric detection of strontium ion was handily
   analyzed to determine the red-green-blue (RGB) value using portable
   devices such as desktop digital scanner and mobile phone camera,
   quantitatively. Interestingly, an orange to dark orange color transition
   was observed when the aqueous and solid paper colorimetric sensor was
   introduced to Sr2+ ion, respectively. It was demonstrated that the value
   of the signal has a linear relationship with concentrations of the
   strontium in the 500 ppm to 100 ppb range with a detection limit of 200
   ppb. We believe that a newly developed Chemo-Paper-Sensor will be useful
   in a wide range of sensing applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have recently become an important research
   field not only because of their important and varied application
   scenarios, including transportation systems, smart homes, surveillance
   systems, and wearable devices but also because the fundamental
   infrastructure has yet to be well addressed. Wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs), as a type of supporting infrastructure, play an irreplaceable
   role in CPS design. Specifically, secure communication in WSNs is vital
   because information transferred in the networks can be easily stolen or
   replaced. Therefore, this paper presents a novel distributed low-storage
   clone detection protocol (LSCD) for WSNs. We first design a detection
   route along the perpendicular direction of a witness path with witness
   nodes deployed in a ring path. This ensures that the detection route
   must encounter the witness path because the distance between any two
   detection routes must be smaller than the witness path length. In the
   LSCD protocol, clone detection is processed in a nonhotspot region where
   a large amount of energy remains, which can improve energy efficiency as
   well as network lifetime. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
   lifetime, storage requirements, and detection probability of our
   protocol are substantially improved over competing solutions from the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with false signal injection attack detection
   mechanism using a novel distributed event-triggered filtering for cyber
   physical systems over sensor networks. By the Internet of Things, the
   classic physical systems are transformed to the networked cyber physical
   systems, which are built with a large number of distributed networked
   sensors. In order to save the precious network resources, a novel
   distributed event-triggered strategy is proposed. Under this strategy,
   to generate the localized residual signals, the event-triggered
   distributed fault detection filters are proposed. By Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional theory, the distributed fault detection filtering problem can
   be formulated as stability and an H-infinity performance of the residual
   system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived such that the
   resultant residual system is stable while the transmission of the
   sampled data is reduced. Based on this condition, the codesign method of
   the fault detection filters and the transmission strategy is proposed.
   An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Devices that monitor and measure various system parameters or physical
   phenomena form an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Such devices
   usually operate continuously and gather important data that is often
   critical for the operation of the underlying system. Thus, it becomes
   important to understand and detect abnormal or malicious device
   behavior, false injection of data by an adversary, or other security
   threats that may lead to incorrect measurement data. This paper
   addresses the problem of detection of anomalies in diurnal traffic
   volume data in an intelligent transportation system. The proposed
   approach leverages the statistical properties of the data to perform
   anomaly detection by calculating the `local density' of the data points.
   Anomalous behavior in the traffic volumes reported by road segments is
   calculated based on sparse local density of the data points. Our
   approach for detecting anomalies does not require any information about
   the outside factors which might have influenced the data. The proposed
   approach has been evaluated on attacks simulated on transportation data
   collected by the New York State Department of Transportation. The
   proposed approach also extends to other cyber-physical systems where the
   monitored data exhibits diurnal patterns.}},

   fault detection technique is applied to detect and track fault data
   injection attacks on the cooperative adaptive cruise control layer of a
   platoon of connected vehicles in real time. A decision support system
   was developed to reduce the probability and severity of any consequent

Abstract = {{Increasing number of physical systems being connected to the internet
   raises security concerns about the possibility of cyber-attacks that can
   cause severe physical damage. Signature-based malware protection can
   detect known hazards, but cannot protect against new attacks with
   unknown attack signatures. Anomaly detection mechanisms are often used
   in combination with signature-based anti-viruses, however, they too have
   a weakness of triggering on any new previously unseen activity, even if
   the activity is legitimate. In this paper, we present a solution to the
   problem of protecting an industrial process from cyber attacks, having
   robotic manufacture facilities with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) as
   our use case. Our solution combines detection of danger signals with
   anomaly detection in order to minimize mis-labelling of legitimate new
   behaviour as dangerous.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for detecting replay attacks on cyber-physical systems is
   presented in this paper. The diagnosis system under a replay attack will
   not trigger an alarm as long as the received sensor readings are
   plausible. Since an adversary is not able to react on system changes due
   to the simplicity of the attack and a lack of system knowledge, our goal
   is to excite the system in non-regular time intervals. Subsequently we
   can check by means of signal processing whether the received sensor
   readings are valid. To excite harmonic oscillations, we insert a
   nonlinear element in the control loop and exploit the theory of
   describing functions. Since the nonlinear function is a design
   parameter, we are able to design robust harmonic oscillations. Another
   advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility of elegant
   implementation into existing control systems.}},

   strategies are very sophisticated and rely on perfect system knowledge.
   The resulting attack signal is completely invisible in the sensor
   readings. Hence an ordinary fault diagnosis system is not able to detect
   such attacks and to trigger an alarm. Our goal is to insert a modulation
   matrix in the path of the control variables. By altering the input
   behavior of the process, the adversary will lose his perfect system
   knowledge and therefore his attacks can be revealed. We design the
   modulation matrix by focusing on covert attacks. By guaranteeing that
   the modulation changes the input directions, we unmask zero dynamics
   attacks as well, since multivariable zeros depend on frequency and

Abstract = {{Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an important clinical
   problem of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which incurs
   approximately 90\% of all TBI-related costs. However, current detection
   approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria,
   paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already
   overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed
   recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we
   design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for
   early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First,
   a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria.
   With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and
   integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our
   system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to
   relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and
   provide timely decision supports. Evaluations on 107 clinical cases
   extracted from medical publications demonstrate the effectiveness and
   the efficiency of our integrated system.}},

   is used to identify different types of intrusion signatures and
   features. Chi-Square test and Correlation matrix is used to select
   relevant features and then the sets of features help to classify the

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are used to control chemical processes, and
   can be found in manufacturing, civil infrastructure, energy industry,
   transportation and in many more places. There is one common
   characteristic in these areas, their operation is critical as a
   malfunction can potential be life-threatening. In the past, an attack
   against the cyber part of the systems can lead to physical consequences.
   The first well known attack against a CPS was Stuxnet in 2010. It is
   challenging to develop countermeasures in this field without endangering
   the normal operation of the underlying system. In our research, our goal
   was to detect attacks without interfering with the cyber physical
   systems in any way. This can be realized by an anomaly detection system
   using passive network monitoring. Our approach is based on analysing the
   state of the physical process by interpreting the communication between
   the control system and the supervisory system. This state can be
   compared to a model based prediction of the system, which can serve as a
   solid base for intrusion detection. In order to realize our intrusion
   detection system, a testbed was built based on widely used Siemens PLCs.
   Our implementation consists of three main parts. The first task is to
   understand the network communication in order to gain information about
   the controlled process. This was realized by analysing and deeply
   understanding the publicly undocumented Siemens management protocol. The
   resulting protocol parser was integrated into the widely-used Bro
   network security monitoring framework. Gathering information about the
   process state for a prolonged time creates time series. With these time
   series, as the second step, statistical models of the physical process
   can be built to predict future states. As the final step, the new states
   of the physical process can be compared with the predicted states.
   Significant differences can be considered as an indicator of compromise.}},

   in most of the areas of our lives ensuring security has become a
   critical issue. Protecting data from unwanted access by modifying it

   prevent attacks. We propose a system with hierarchical access to data
   which is gained through a digital signature algorithm. We focus our
   attention on detecting and preventing attacks through a less
   conventional method - complex event processing. Any action within the
   cyber-physical system can be viewed as an event, such as digitally

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) uses Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., 3D
   Printers) that are vulnerable to kinetic cyber-attacks. Kinetic
   cyber-attacks cause physical damage to the system from the cyber domain.
   In AM, kinetic cyber-attacks are realized by introducing flaws in the
   design of the 3D objects. These flaws may eventually compromise the
   structural integrity of the printed objects. In CPS, researchers have
   designed various attack detection method to detect the attacks on the
   integrity of the system. However, in AM, attack detection method is in
   its infancy. Moreover, analog emissions (such as acoustics,
   electromagnetic emissions, etc.) from the side-channels of AM have not
   been fully considered as a parameter for attack detection. To aid the
   security research in AM, this paper presents a novel attack detection
   method that is able to detect zero-day kinetic cyber-attacks on AM by
   identifying anomalous analog emissions which arise as an outcome of the
   attack. This is achieved by statistically estimating functions that map
   the relation between the analog emissions and the corresponding cyber
   domain data (such as G-code) to model the behavior of the system. Our
   method has been tested to detect potential zero-day kinetic
   cyber-attacks in fused deposition modeling based AM. These attacks can
   physically manifest to change various parameters of the 3D object, such
   as speed, dimension, and movement axis. Accuracy, defined as the
   capability of our method to detect the range of variations introduced to
   these parameters as a result of kinetic cyber-attacks, is 77.45\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the engineering of cyber-physical systems the engineering process
   typically focuses on single systems and not on the entire system
   network. Within the system network the different specification artifacts
   (in consequence also the implemented systems) for the various
   cyber-physical systems evolve independently even though they highly
   interact with each other. As a result, inconsistencies between the
   different specification artifacts can emerge. An inconsistency implies
   that at least one artifact is incorrect. Following, specification
   inconsistencies among single cyber-physical systems within an entire
   system network endanger correct functioning of the network. Hence, it is
   of importance to identify all existing inconsistencies and to correct
   the corresponding artifacts. Therefore, this paper suggests a solution
   concept for supporting the identification and repair of inconsistencies
   in interaction-based specification artifacts. The approach relies (i) on
   the automated detection of inconsistencies among overlapping
   specification artifacts of different systems participating in the same
   cyber-physical network, and (ii) on the automated proposal of valid
   solution options to aid the engineers in decision making w.r.t.
   resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we apply the solution idea
   to ITU message sequence charts as a typical notation format for

   discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of
   a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn
   system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The
   results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions
   is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for
   anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes
   with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems are critical to the infrastructure of a country.
   They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of
   off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on
   World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated
   their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network
   security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead
   to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the
   departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to
   build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time
   to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning
   intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the
   physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate
   of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment
   facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits
   a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model
   can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The cyber security problem is posing new challenges to the current
   safety analysis of nuclear power plants. Historically, analogue control
   systems in the absence of interactive communications are immune to
   cyber-attacks; however, digital control systems with extensive
   interconnection of reprogrammable components are intensely vulnerable to
   cyber-attacks which shed light on the significance and urgency of the
   cyber security. The current cyber security approaches, which merely
   focus on information networks, have not given multifaceted
   considerations to instrumentation and control (I\&C) systems. The
   cyber-attack on I\&C systems may lead to more severe consequences,
   including the abnormal change of parameters, the malfunction of
   equipment, and even the accident condition. The existing cyber security
   approaches for information networks, such as firewalls, encryption, can
   enhance the cyber security of I\&C systems, but are often insufficient
   in addressing challenges associate with the I\&C systems which link
   cyber space and physical systems. The defense approach based on physical
   information should be developed to meet the emerging challenges. In this
   paper, we propose the cyber-physical security (CPS) approach based on
   the physical process data for the cyber defense. This approach does not
   intend to replace current cyber defense mechanisms. It could be served
   as the last barrier for security defense. The goal of the CPS defense
   approach is to detect attacks at the beginning of the occurrence of
   physical process anomalies cause by cyber-attacks. A practical
   implementation of the CPS approach is proposed and its influence on the
   existing infrastructure is discussed. The statistical analysis
   techniques are utilized on physical process data for attack detection.
   The method of dynamic principal component analysis (dynamic PCA) is
   employed to characterize the correlation of multiple variables in the
   normal operational condition. In the abnormal operational occurrence,
   the chi-square detector is able to distinguish adversarial cyber-attacks
   from ordinary random failures.}},

Abstract = {{Due to global competition and increasing product complexity, the
   complexity of production systems has grown significantly in recent
   years. This places an increasing burden on automation developers,
   systems engineers and plant constructors. Intelligent assistance systems
   and smart automation systems are a possible solution to face this
   complexity: The machines, i.e. the software and assistance systems, take
   over tasks that were previously carried out manually by experts. At the
   heart of this concept are intelligent anomaly detection approaches based
   on models of the system behaviors. Intelligent assistance systems learn
   these models automatically: Based on data, these systems extract most
   necessary knowledge about the diagnosis task. This paper outlines this
   data-driven approach to plant analysis using several use cases from

Abstract = {{The main aim of this paper is to provide intensive solution for heart
   attack through Cyber Physical System (CPS). Cyber Physical System is one
   of the blooming technologies with wide range of applications. Currently
   the interest towards design and implementation of CPS is highly
   increasing. It is expected that CPS will play a vital role in the
   progress of upcoming embedded systems. In this paper we have proposed a
   system to provide efficient and quick solution to heart attack patients
   who are at great risk. Advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
   (MEMS) technology has created an enormous impact on the current medical
   health care scenario. It has enabled the design of small sized wireless
   communication systems at low cost. A small wearable wireless monitoring
   system inspects the patient's ECG signals continuously and transmits the
   signals to decision making and control systems. The control system is
   capable of controlling the actuation system which is fitted to the body
   of the patients. The warning system sends an alert in case of emergency
   to the caretakers mobile. Our proposed system uses low cost, energy
   efficient and reliable zigbee technology for communication among the
   physical components and hence the effectiveness of the system is
   improved. This life saving system reduces the mortality rate of heart
   patients and it act as an effective heart care service to patients.}},

Abstract = {{As the maliciousness and frequency of cyber-attacks continues to grow,
   the safety and security of cyber-physical critical infrastructures, such
   as manufacturing, is quickly becoming a significant concern across the
   globe. Outside of traditional intellectual property theft, attacks
   against manufacturing systems pose a threat to maintaining a product's
   design intent. More specifically, such attacks can alter a manufacturing
   system to produce a part incorrectly; resulting in impaired
   functionalities or reduced performance. Manufacturing systems rely
   heavily upon the use of quality control systems to detect quality losses
   and to ensure the continued production of high-quality parts. However,
   quality control systems are not designed to detect the effects of
   malicious attacks and are ill-suited to act as a cyber-security measure
   for many manufacturing systems. Therefore, this paper presents a novel
   product/process design approach to enable real-time attack detections to
   supplement the shortcomings of quality control systems. The proposed
   approach, inspired by side-channel schemes used to detect Trojans
   (foreign malicious logic) in integrated circuits, aims at detecting
   changes to a manufactured part's intrinsic behavior through the use of
   structural health monitoring techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (i.e.,
   sensors) with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context
   sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in
   real-world situations. A core element of CPS is the collection and
   assessment of information from noisy, dynamic, and uncertain physical
   environments that must be transformed into usable knowledge in
   real-time. Machine learning algorithms such as cluster analysis can be
   used to extract useful information and patterns from data generated from
   physical devices based on which novel applications of CPS can make
   informed decisions. In this paper we propose to use a density-based data
   stream clustering algorithm, built on the Multiple Species Flocking
   model, for the monitoring of big data, generated from numerous
   applications such as machine monitoring, health monitoring, sensor
   networks. In the proposed approach, approximate results are available on

   intrusion detection of medical devices embedded in a medical cyber
   physical system (MCPS) in which the patient's safety is of the utmost

   state machine, so that a device that is being monitored for its behavior
   can easily be checked against the transformed state machine for
   deviation from its behavior specification. Using vital sign monitor
   medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion
   detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high
   detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden
   attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications. Moreover,
   through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our behavior-rule
   specification-based IDS technique outperforms two existing anomaly-based

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical
   processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
   physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
   affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the
   eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the
   President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will
   be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial
   control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random
   failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their
   growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect
   for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion
   detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any
   harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined
   universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism
   remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss
   how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in
   this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to
   define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the
   intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the
   layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some
   significant research problems are identified for enlightening the
   subsequent studies.}},

   classify modern CPS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques based on
   two design dimensions: detection technique and audit material. We
   summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension's options. We also
   summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the

   they apply to CPSs. Finally, we identify gaps in CPS IDS research and

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial cause of urinary tract
   infections. Its rapid and specific identification in urine samples
   represents a major challenge within the rendering results and optimizing
   the management of the patient. We aimed to compare the sensitivity and
   specificity,of two commercially available chromogenic media for E. coli:
   ChromID CPS (R) (Biomerieux) and UriSelect4 (R) (Bio-Rad), without
   carrying out further tests. 99 consecutive and non-redundant urine
   samples considered to be infected were simultaneously plated onto blood
   agar and the two chromogenic media. Colony color and bacterial growth
   quantification were compared 18 and 48 hours after incubation. Bacteria
   were identified with mass spectrometry. A complementary analysis on 80
   bacterial strains known to pose potential identification problems was
   performed. 43 urines samples grew E. coli, and 42 of them were
   pink-colored on the two chromogenic mediums, as expected
   (sensibility=97.7\%). Growth quantification was significantly greater on
   blood agar than on chromogenic media (p<0.001).We noted specificity
   issues at the complementary analysis with the UriSelect4 (R) medium:
   Citrobacter freundii and some strains of Citrobacter brakii,
   Enterobacter cloacae and Hafnia alvei were pink-colored, and could be
   misidentified as E. coli. ChromID CPS (R) medium did not show such
   misidentification. In conclusion, the agar ChromID CPS (R) proved to be
   greater than the UriSelect4 (R) agar in our work in terms of specificity
   of direct identification of E. Coli, without the use of additional test.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalies in cyber-physical systems may arise due to malicious cyber
   attacks or operational faults in the physical devices. Accurately
   detecting the anomalies and isolating their root-causes is important for
   identifying appropriate reactive and preventive measures and building
   resilient cyber-physical systems. Anomaly detection and isolation in
   cyber-physical systems is challenging, because the impact of a cyber
   attack on the operation of a physical system may manifest itself only
   after some time. In this paper, we present a Bayesian network approach
   for learning the causal relations between cyber and physical variables
   as well as their temporal correlations from unlabeled data. We describe
   the data transformations that we performed to deal with the
   heterogeneous characteristics of the cyber and physical data, so that
   the integrated dataset can be used to learn the Bayesian network
   structure and parameters. We then present scalable algorithms to detect
   different anomalies and isolate their respective root-cause using a
   Bayesian network. We also present results from evaluating our algorithms
   on an unlabeled dataset consisting of anomalies due to cyber attacks and
   physical faults in a commercial building system.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of technology used in operation, monitoring, and
   control introduces several threats against power system. Cyber-physical
   power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of
   attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and
   attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers
   require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for
   simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such
   a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction
   to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the
   development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems.
   The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital
   simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a
   MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a
   platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system
   attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers.
   Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are
   implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system
   {[}11]. Fault, contingency and cyber-attack scenarios have been
   developed for both power systems. Selected relevant simulation results
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and localization of damage in a timely manner is critical
   in order to avoid the failure of structures. When a structure is
   subjected to an unscheduled impulsive force, the resulting damage can
   lead to failure in a very short period of time. As such, a monitoring
   strategy that can adapt to variability in the environment and that
   anticipates changes in physical processes has the potential of
   detecting, locating and mitigating damage. These requirements can be met
   by a Structural Control (SC) system that is capable of measuring and
   analyzing dynamic responses in real time. Such a system requires an
   effective damage identification method capable of locating and
   quantifying damage. The Eigenparameter Decomposition (ED) of Structural
   Flexibility Change method is validated with real data and can be used in
   the computational core of this system. The condition screening is
   implemented on a damaged structure and compared to an original baseline
   calculation, hence providing a supervised learning environment. A
   laboratory-scale experimental study on a 5-story shear building with
   different damage conditions subjected to an impulsive force has been
   chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The
   effectiveness of the ED method to locate damage is compared to that of
   the Damage Index method. The ED method has also been modified to be able
   to locate and quantify damage. The experimental study shows the
   effectiveness of the modified method.}},

Abstract = {{Senior Collapse Detection (SCD) is a system that uses cyber-physical
   techniques to create a ``smart home{''} system to predict and detect the
   falling of senior/geriatric participants in home environments. This
   software application addresses the needs of millions of senior citizens
   who live at home by themselves and can find themselves in situations
   where they have fallen and need assistance. We discuss how SCD uses
   imagery, depth and audio to fuse and interact in a system that does not
   require the senior to wear any devices allowing them to be more
   autonomous. The Microsoft Kinect Sensor is used to collect imagery,
   depth and audio. We will begin by discussing the physical attributes of
   the ``collapse detection problem{''}. Next, we will discuss the task of
   feature extraction resulting in skeleton and joint tracking.
   Improvements in error detection of joint tracking will be highlighted.
   Next, we discuss the main module of ``fall detection{''} using our
   mid-level skeleton features. Attributes including acceleration, position
   and room environment factor into the SCD fall detection decision.
   Finally, how a detected fall and the resultant emergency response are
   handled will be presented. Results in a home environment will be given.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of cyber-physical systems increases, so does the
   number of ways an adversary can disrupt them. This necessitates
   automated anomaly detection methods to detect possible threats. In this
   paper, we extend our recent results in the field of inference via formal
   methods to develop an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our procedure
   constructs from data a signal temporal logic (STL) formula that
   describes normal system behavior. Trajectories that do not satisfy the
   learned formula are flagged as anomalous. STL can be used to formulate
   properties such as ``If the train brakes within 500 m of the platform at
   a speed of 50 km/hr, then it will stop in at least 30 s and at most 50
   s.{''} STL gives a more human-readable representation of behavior than
   classifiers represented as surfaces in high-dimensional feature spaces.
   STL formulae can also be used for early detection via online monitoring
   and for anomaly mitigation via formal synthesis. We demonstrate the
   power of our method with a physical model of a train's brake system. To
   our knowledge, this paper is the first instance of formal methods being
   applied to anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) employ sensors to observe physical
   environments and to detect events of interest. Equipped with sensing,
   computing, and communication capabilities, Cyber-Physical Systems aim to
   make physical-systems smart(er). For example, smart electricity meters
   nowadays measure and report power consumption as well as critical events
   such as power outages. However, each day, such sensors report a variety
   of warnings and errors: many merely indicate transient faults or short
   instabilities of the physical system (environment). Thus, given the big
   volumes of data, the time-efficient processing of these events,
   especially in large-scale scenarios with hundreds of thousands of
   sensors, is a key challenge in CPSs.
   Motivated by the fact that critical events of CPSs often have
   temporal-spatial properties, we focus on identifying critical events by
   an online temporal-spatial analysis on the data stream of messages. We
   explicitly model the online detection problem as a single-linkage
   clustering on a data stream over a sliding-window, where the inherent
   computational complexity of the detection problem is derived. Based on
   this model, we propose a grid-based single-linkage clustering algorithm
   over a sliding-window, which is an online time-space efficient method
   satisfying the quick processing demand of big data streams. We analyze
   the performance of the proposed approach by both a series of
   propositions and a large, real-world data-set of deployed CPS, composing
   300,000 sensors, over one year. We show that the proposed method
   identifies above 9 5 \% of the critical events in the data-set and save
   the time-space requirement by 4 orders of magnitude compared with the
   conventional clustering method.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an integration of physical processes with
   computation and communication. CPS connects the virtual world with
   physical world. It has the ability to add more intelligence to social
   life. A CPS integrates physical devices, such as sensors and cameras,
   with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated
   analytical system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in the
   real-world scenarios. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be a vital part
   of CPS as strong sensing capabilities can be one of the major driving
   factors for CPS applications. Still CPS is considered as a nascent
   technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These
   challenges are often posed due to the complexity of communication,
   computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide
   ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living,
   environmental control and traffic management. Unfortunately, no unified
   architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations
   among the applications. In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of
   medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number
   of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the
   efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few CPS healthcare
   architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all
   lack of efficient false alarm detection. In this paper, a novel false
   alarm detection architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare
   applications. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This article consists of two parts: a theoretical part concerned with
   fault detection schemes, and an application part dealing with cyber
   security of power systems. In the first part, we develop a tractable
   approach to design a robust residual generator to detect and isolate
   faults in high dimensional nonlinear systems. Previous approaches on
   fault detection and isolation problems are either confined to linear
   systems or they are only applicable to low dimensional dynamics with
   more specific structures. In contrast, we propose a novel methodology to
   robustify a linear residual generator for a nonlinear system in the
   presence of certain disturbance signatures. To this end, we formulate
   the problem into the framework of quadratic programming which enables us
   to solve relatively high dimensional systems. In the second part, the
   application is motivated by the emerging problem of cyber security in
   power networks. We provide description of a multi-machine power system
   that represents a two-area power system, and we model a cyber-physical
   attack emanating from the vulnerabilities introduced by the interaction
   between IT infrastructure and power system. The algorithm developed in
   the first part is finally used to diagnose such an intrusion before the
   functionality of the power system is disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel event detection algorithm in Cyber-Physical
   Systems that uses the concept of interrupts in embedded systems. An
   event is produced when a new entity emerges in an area. We use the term
   distributed interrupt due to the distributed nature of an emergent
   event. Our algorithm generates distributed interrupts using
   decentralized inter-node collaborations, computes interrupt latency
   accurately with unsynchronized nodes, produces a distributed stack that
   saves the current state of the distributed system, and determines the
   criticality of processing a distributed interrupt to compute interrupt
   priorities and application-specific timing constraints.}},

   detection techniques, namely, positional discontinuity and
   enviroconsistency, for intrusion detection of malicious attackers in a
   CPS. We utilize the hierarchical model developed to analyze the
   performance characteristics of these two techniques and identify optimal
   design settings under which the reliability of the CPS may be maximized.
   The analysis reveals design tradeoffs in security assurance and energy
   consumption, and suggests that enviroconsistency be used over positional
   discontinuity for reliability maximization. Numerical results with
   physical interpretations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The failure of non-leaf nodes in Application Layer Multicast (ALM) tree
   partitions the multicast tree, which may significantly degrade the
   quality of multicast service. Accurate and timely failure recovery from
   node failures in ALM tree, which is based on the premise of efficient
   failure detection scheme, is critical to minimize the disruption of
   service. In fact, failure detection has hardly been studied in the
   context of ALM. Firstly, this paper analyzes the failure detection
   issues in ALM and then proposes a model which is based on the
   relationship between parent and child nodes for it. Secondly, the
   Cooperative-Probe based failure detection Scheme (CPS), in which the
   information about probe loss is shared among monitor nodes, is designed
   Thirdly, the performance of CPS is analyzed. The Numerical results show
   that our proposed scheme can simultaneously reduce the detection time
   and the probability of false positive at the cost of little increased
   control overhead by comparing with the Basic-Probe based failure
   detection Scheme (BPS). Finally, some possible directions for the future
   work are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an anomaly intrusion detection model based on
   shuffle operation and product machines targeting persistent
   interposition attacks on control systems. These attacks actually are
   undetectable by the most advanced system call monitors as they issue no
   system calls and are stealthy enough to transfer control to hijacked
   library functions without letting their saved instruction Pointers get
   stored on stack. We exploit the fact that implementations of control
   protocols running in control systems, which in turn are attached to
   physical systems such as power plants and electrical substations,
   exhibit strong regularities in terms of sequences of function calls and
   system calls issued during protocol transactions. The main idea behind
   the proposed approach is to introduce NULL function calls within a
   Modbus binary and to apply the shuffle operation between them and
   existing function calls. We then devise and implement a product machine
   capable of recognizing the shuffle representation of function call and
   system call regularities. A sensor uses a unidirectional interprocess
   communication channel based on shared memory to receive profile data
   from a Modbus process, and subsequently submits them to the product
   machine. We describe an experimental evaluation of our model on an
   ARM-based Modbus device and demonstrate that the proposed model
   overcomes the limitations of state of the art approaches with regard to
   detection of persistent interposition attacks on control systems.}},
