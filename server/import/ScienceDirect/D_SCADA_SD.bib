abstract = "The adoption of open and widely used standards led to an increase in the grade of exposure and vulnerability in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Therefore, the development of novel Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) specifically for SCADA systems is receiving a considerable attention from the scientific community. This paper goes beyond existing proposals and provides not only a novel ADS, but also a novel methodology for automatically configuring Snort-based ADSs deployed in SCADA systems. The methodology includes a graphical interface, a formal language, and shell scripts, used to model SCADA topologies and to automatically generate ADS rules. The approach is validated through several experiments and shows good performance with large topologies involving 100 LANs, 1000 hosts and 100 ADSs."

The nature and characteristics of SCADA systems call for special considerations and techniques of intrusion detection. Many works have been made in this field, ranging from generic intrusion detection techniques to customized solutions designed specifically for SCADA systems. In the recent years, some works have focused on using physical metrics in addition to the popular network-based and host-based intrusion detection approaches. This paper presents a taxonomy that considers the special features of cyberphysical intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with examples from the literature. Moreover, a case study is presented for a simulated gas pipeline dataset to compare the effectiveness of decision tree classifiers for various categories of features in SCADA systems. The results show that an IDS that uses a combination of physical and network metrics significantly outperforms an IDS that only uses network metrics or physical metrics."

Over the last two decades, connecting critical infrastructures to the Internet has become essential due to performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction, can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect."

Analysis of cointegration residuals – obtained from cointegration process of wind turbine data – is used for operational condition monitoring and automated fault and/or abnormal condition detection. The proposed method is validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and operational conditions. A two-stage cointegration-based procedure is performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data trends have nonlinear characteristics. The method is tested using two case studies with known faults. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively analyse nonlinear data trends, continuously monitor the wind turbine and reliably detect abnormal problems."

In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase, the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared to three well-known anomaly detection approaches."

Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate."

An automatic classifier was developed to identify these classes. Additionally, parameterized behavior models were created for each class. During its learning phase, the anomaly detection system used the classifier to identify the different types of registers and instantiated the model for each register based on its type. During the enforcement phase, the system detected deviations from the model. The anomaly detection system was evaluated using 131h of traffic from a production SCADA system. The classifier had a true positive classification rate of 93%. During the enforcement phase, a 0.86% false alarm rate was obtained for the correctly-classified registers."

SCADA systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate, since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism."

The current trend in this field of research is to develop malfunction detection indicators from analog signals recorded by operation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), creating behavioral models of the equipment and the development of a series of status indicators. These models and indicators are used to detect malfunctions when operation SCADA are unable to detect an abnormality, thus determining that the component is beginning to degrade when certain normal limits are exceeded. However, the digital signals from operation SCADA have great potential for providing additional information that could be used to detect possible malfunction. Detection must be accompanied by a study of the remaining life of a component so that the remaining useful life of the component before failure can be estimated before losing its functionality. If SCADA can detect a malfunction and determine when the component will break, the operator will have valuable time to intervene prior to failure at an optimum time. This is particularly important in installations with difficult access, such as offshore wind farms."

This paper presents a model-based intrusion detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages. The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate—perfect matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111h of operation. Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured incorrectly."

abstract = "Numerous intelligent fault diagnosis models have been developed on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of wind turbines, so as to process massive SCADA data effectively and accurately. However, there is a problem ignored among these studies. That is, SCADA data distribution is imbalanced and the anomalous data mining is not sufficient. The amount of normal data is much more than that of abnormal data, which makes these models tend to be biased toward majority class, i.e., normal data, while accuracy of diagnosing fault is poor. Aimed at overcoming this problem, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis methodology is proposed based on exquisitely designed deep neural networks. The between-classes imbalance problem is handled by learning deep representation that can preserve within-class information and between-classes information based on triplet loss. The proposed method encourages a pair of data belonging to same class to be projected onto points as close as possible in new embedding space. It tries to enforce a margin between different class data. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method are validated on the SCADA data of two wind turbines containing blades icing accretion fault. The result demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the traditional normal behavior modeling method."

However, the changes in the features of hardware sensor measurements, which are used in current SCADA systems, often cannot provide reliable early alarms. In order to resolve this problem, in this paper, a novel dynamic model sensor method is proposed for the SCADA data based wind turbine fault detection. A dynamic model representing the relationship between the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature is derived following the first principles and used as the basic structure of the model sensor. When the model sensor is applied for fault detection, its parameters are updated regularly using the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature data from the SCADA system. Then, from the updated model, the fault sensitive features of wind turbine system are extracted via performing system frequency analysis and used for the turbine fault detection. This novel model sensor method is applied to the SCADA data of a wind farm of 3 wind turbines currently operating in Spain. The results show that the proposed method can not only detect the turbine generator fault but also reveal the trend of ageing with the wind turbine generator, demonstrating its capability of failure prognosis for wind turbine system and components."

Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach."
