Therefore, the development of novel Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) specifically for SCADA systems is receiving a considerable attention from the scientific community. This paper goes beyond existing proposals and provides not only a novel ADS, but also a novel methodology for automatically configuring Snort-based ADSs deployed in SCADA systems. The methodology includes a graphical interface, a formal language, and shell scripts, used to model SCADA topologies and to automatically generate ADS rules. The approach is validated through several experiments and shows good performance with large topologies involving 100 LANs, 1000 hosts and 100 ADSs."

Many works have been made in this field, ranging from generic intrusion detection techniques to customized solutions designed specifically for SCADA systems. In the recent years, some works have focused on using physical metrics in addition to the popular network-based and host-based intrusion detection approaches. This paper presents a taxonomy that considers the special features of cyberphysical intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with examples from the literature. Moreover, a case study is presented for a simulated gas pipeline dataset to compare the effectiveness of decision tree classifiers for various categories of features in SCADA systems. The results show that an IDS that uses a combination of physical and network metrics significantly outperforms an IDS that only uses network metrics or physical metrics."

Over the last two decades, connecting critical infrastructures to the Internet has become essential due to performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction, can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect."

The proposed method is validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and operational conditions. A two-stage cointegration-based procedure is performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data trends have nonlinear characteristics.

In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase, the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared to three well-known anomaly detection approaches."

Identifying and detecting intrusions in a SCADA is a critical and demanding task in recent days. For this purpose, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are developed in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks including it has high false positive and false negative rates, it cannot detect the encrypted date and it supports only for detecting the external intrusions. In order to overcome all these issues, an Intrusion Weighted Particle based Cuckoo Search Optimization (IWP-CSO) and Hierarchical Neuron Architecture based Neural Network (HNA-NN) techniques are proposed in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to detect and classify the intrusions in a SCADA network based on the optimization. At first, the input network dataset is given as the input, where the attributes are arranged and the clusters are initialized. Then, the features are optimized to select the best attributes by using the proposed IWP-CSO algorithm. Finally, the intrusions in a network are classified by employing the proposed HNA-AA algorithm. The experimental results evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, Jaccard, Dice and false detection rate."

The presence of a real time intrusion detection mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate, since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism."

The current trend in this field of research is to develop malfunction detection indicators from analog signals recorded by operation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), creating behavioral models of the equipment and the development of a series of status indicators. These models and indicators are used to detect malfunctions when operation SCADA are unable to detect an abnormality, thus determining that the component is beginning to degrade when certain normal limits are exceeded. However, the digital signals from operation SCADA have great potential for providing additional information that could be used to detect possible malfunction. Detection must be accompanied by a study of the remaining life of a component so that the remaining useful life of the component before failure can be estimated before losing its functionality. If SCADA can detect a malfunction and determine when the component will break, the operator will have valuable time to intervene prior to failure at an optimum time. This is particularly important in installations with difficult access, such as offshore wind farms."

This paper presents a model-based intrusion detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages. The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate—perfect matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111h of operation. Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured incorrectly."

However, there is a problem ignored among these studies. That is, SCADA data distribution is imbalanced and the anomalous data mining is not sufficient. The amount of normal data is much more than that of abnormal data, which makes these models tend to be biased toward majority class, i.e., normal data, while accuracy of diagnosing fault is poor. Aimed at overcoming this problem, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis methodology is proposed based on exquisitely designed deep neural networks. The between-classes imbalance problem is handled by learning deep representation that can preserve within-class information and between-classes information based on triplet loss. The proposed method encourages a pair of data belonging to same class to be projected onto points as close as possible in new embedding space. It tries to enforce a margin between different class data. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method are validated on the SCADA data of two wind turbines containing blades icing accretion fault. The result demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the traditional normal behavior modeling method."

However, the changes in the features of hardware sensor measurements, which are used in current SCADA systems, often cannot provide reliable early alarms. In order to resolve this problem, in this paper, a novel dynamic model sensor method is proposed for the SCADA data based wind turbine fault detection. A dynamic model representing the relationship between the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature is derived following the first principles and used as the basic structure of the model sensor. When the model sensor is applied for fault detection, its parameters are updated regularly using the generator temperature, wind speed, and ambient temperature data from the SCADA system. Then, from the updated model, the fault sensitive features of wind turbine system are extracted via performing system frequency analysis and used for the turbine fault detection. This novel model sensor method is applied to the SCADA data of a wind farm of 3 wind turbines currently operating in Spain. The results show that the proposed method can not only detect the turbine generator fault but also reveal the trend of ageing with the wind turbine generator, demonstrating its capability of failure prognosis for wind turbine system and components."

Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach."

Detection and prevention of anomalous behaviors such as cyber attacks are of vital importance. This paper focuses on a method to detect such anomalous behaviors in near real-time using laptop class processing power. ICSs depend on the sensor measurements to monitor and operate a plant. Moreover, any change in the behaviors of a physical process due to an attack can also be unearthed from the sensor measurements. Under different circumstances, these sensor measurements follow typical patterns. A partially defined Boolean function based supervised classification method, known as Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), can extract patterns (or rules) from historical sensor measurements, and these rules can categorize the condition of a plant. In this paper, these rules are used to design an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) to unearth anomalous behaviors. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed using the sensor measurements from a testbed known as Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. The proposed technique is generic and can be extended to other ICSs such as power and transportation. Additionally, compared to other anomaly detection approaches, LAD-based ADS also helps to localize the anomaly."

In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems.

This paper presents a novel approach that uses timing-based side channel analysis to establish a unique device fingerprint that helps detect unauthorized modifications of the device. The approach is applied to an Allen Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controller where execution time measurements are collected and analyzed by a custom anomaly detection system to detect abnormal behavior.

Existing methods of detecting cyber-attacks, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs), are commonly implemented in ICS and SCADA networks. However, these devices do not detect more complex threats that manifest themselves gradually over a period of time through a combination of unusual sequencing of activities, such as process-related attacks. During the normal operation of ICSs, ICS devices record device logs, capturing their industrial processes over time. These logs are a rich source of information that should be analysed in order to detect such process-related attacks. In this paper, we present a novel process mining anomaly detection method for identifying anomalous behaviour and cyber-attacks using ICS data logs and the conformance checking analysis technique from the process mining discipline. A conformance checking analysis uses logs captured from production systems with a process model (which captures the expected behaviours of a system) to determine the extent to which real behaviours (captured in the logs) matches the expected behaviours (captured in the process model). The contributions of this paper include an experimentally derived recommendation for logging practices on ICS devices, for the purpose of process mining-based analysis; a formalised approach for pre-processing and transforming device logs from ICS systems into event logs suitable for process mining analysis; guidance on how to create a process model for ICSs and how to apply the created process model through a conformance checking analysis to identify anomalous behaviours. Our anomaly detection method has been successfully applied in detecting ICS cyber-attacks, which the widely used IDS Snort does not detect, using logs derived from industry standard ICS devices."

abstract = "Most of the machine learning-based intrusion detection tools developed for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are trained on network packet captures, and they rely on monitoring network layer traffic alone for intrusion detection. This approach produces weak intrusion detection systems, as ICS cyber-attacks have a real and significant impact on the process variables. A limited number of researchers consider integrating process measurements. However, in complex systems, process variable changes could result from different combinations of abnormal occurrences. This paper examines recent advances in intrusion detection algorithms, their limitations, challenges and the status of their application in critical infrastructures. We also introduce the discussion on the similarities and conflicts observed in the development of machine learning tools and techniques for fault diagnosis and cybersecurity in the protection of complex systems and the need to establish a clear difference between them. As a case study, we discuss special characteristics in nuclear power control systems and the factors that constraint the direct integration of security algorithms. Moreover, we discuss data reliability issues and present references and direct URL to recent open-source data repositories to aid researchers in developing data-driven ICS intrusion detection systems."

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively used in modern industries combined with the conventional industrial control system (ICS) network through the industrial cloud to make the production data easily available to the corporate business management and easier control for highly profitable production systems. The different devices within the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection of ICS. Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure. Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of deep learning to design our detection model. Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed detection models is that the models are adaptive where training procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks. Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes, learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms and obtain similar performances with earlier semi-supervised work (Huda et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model."

Knowing the specific waveform of the attack signals can greatly facilitate the design of defense strategy. This paper investigates the attack signal estimation for intrusion detection of actuator false data injection attacks. Taking advantage of extended state observer, the attack signal is described as system disturbance and can be estimated. We propose two attack signal estimators, i.e., linear attack signal estimator (LASE) and nonlinear attack signal estimator (NASE). Through the analysis in the frequency domain, the influence of the attack signal frequency on the estimation performance of LASE is obtained. Both simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed estimators can achieve good performance."

The pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place, unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability, that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS. We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution’s applicability to networked robot control systems."

Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked, out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID, which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared to traditional on-chip sensors."

This structure is much more sensitive to poly stringer defects and is closer to the real product layout than the currently widely used structure using an active dummy underneath a poly comb. Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 μm copper process line were used to compare the current design with the conventional testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width. This structure can be used to identify new designs for manufacturing rules for the active space. Thus, this method is very useful for IC foundries to detect poly stringers and to characterize the processing line capability and tune the process recipe to improve product yields."

abstract = "In high reliability standards fields such as automotive, avionics or aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient methodology for automatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage of the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method which leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the Euclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original coordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments in a context where the dimension of the data is large. Owing to the resulting dimension reduction, ICS is expected to improve the power of outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. The paper includes practical guidelines for using ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the so called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This choice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility to derive theoretical results. The selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and normality tests is addressed. A simulation study confirms the good properties of the proposal and provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance of the proposal is also evaluated on two real data sets using a user-friendly R package accompanying the paper."

Trained experts offer services for evaluating an IC based on destructive or non-destructive methods. However, defect detection and recognition are mostly dependent on human decision, and therefore are vulnerable to error. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect and identify die-face delamination on an IC die. Die-face delamination is a predominant internal defect in recycled ICs but can be easily missed during defect detection. Here, we have acquired the 3D image of an IC non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography and applied image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms on the 3D image to detect die-face delamination in the forms of thermally induced cracks and damaged surfaces."

In serial examinations, the complexed HBsAg levels in 77% of patients with acute hepatitis B decreased progressively in parallel with the free HBsAg levels, and persisted in the remaining 23%. In 19% of patients positive for HBsAg-CICs, the complexed HBsAg levels were higher than those of free HBsAG.

abstract = "This paper is concerned with the detection and compensation co-design issue for cyber-physical systems against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. First, a novel supervisory strategy is proposed based on the concept of packet reception rate, which can detect the behavior of a DoS attacker during a given time window. A quantitative description of the relationship among attack times, time window, attack success rate and packet reception rate is analyzed. Based on the attack detection information, the current state under attack can be successfully reconstructed by some past available states. Then, a co-design compensation mechanism is also obtained, which can further guarantee the attacked system is stochastically stable (without the zero-mean Gaussian white noise) or mean square exponentially ultimately bounded (with the zero-mean Gaussian white noise). The corresponding design conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example are given to show the effectiveness and superiority of the presented design method."

Failure and faulty diagnosis is one of the most complicated and dynamic problems in the industrial plant management since most of failures are extremely ambiguous which needs to be solved based on an expert’s experience. This makes the solutions very subjective and requires too much time, efforts and monetary investment. In this paper, we are proposing new failure detection approach with machine learning and human expertise by using alarm data. As the first step of developing this new method, we collected several types of alarm data that detected functional failure in Hyundai Steel factory. We analyzed and processed the alarm data with 35 domain experts. Based on the data, we propose a knowledge based system which is Ripple Down Rule-based. This system acquires knowledge by machine learning which is maintained by human experts. The evaluation results showed that the proposed failure detection framework can reduce the time of human expertise acquisition and the cost of solving over-generalization and over-fitting problems by using machine learning techniques."

Operation of stage-based CPSs (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art IIDSs directly address cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O CPSs."

Multiple attack scenarios were studied and the proposed state estimation method was found to excel in detecting attacks conducted on sensors within the system; provided that not all sensors are compromised during the attack. However, the proposed methods for subsequent isolation and correction faced limitations due to delays or lack of information to pinpoint the attacked component.

However, due to the high dependence on open information networking, countering FDI attacks is challenging in smart grid CPS. Most existing solutions are based on state estimation (SE) at the highly centralized control center; thus, computationally expensive. In addition, these solutions generally do not provide a high level of security assurance, as evidenced by recent work that smart FDI attackers with knowledge of system configurations can easily circumvent conventional SE-based false data detection mechanisms. In this paper, in order to address these challenges, a novel distributed host-based collaborative detection method is proposed. Specifically, in our approach, we use a conjunctive rule based majority voting algorithm to collaboratively detect false measurement data inserted by compromised phasor measurement units (PMUs). In addition, an innovative reputation system with an adaptive reputation updating algorithm is also designed to evaluate the overall running status of PMUs, by which FDI attacks can be distinctly observed. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted with real-time measurement data obtained from the PowerWorld simulator, and the numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal."

In particular, the method employs a sinusoidal signal with a time-varying frequency (authentication signal) into the closed-loop system and checks whether the time profile of the frequency components in the output signal are compatible with the authentication signal or not. In order to carry out this target, the couplings between inputs and outputs are eliminated using a dynamic decoupling technique based on vector fitting. In this way, a signature introduced on a specific input channel will affect only the output that is selected to be associated with that input, which is a property that can be exploited to determine which channels are being affected. A bank of band-pass filters is used to generate signals whose energies can be compared to reconstruct an estimation of the time-varying frequency profile. By matching the known frequency profile with its estimation, the detector can provide the information about whether a replay attack is being carried out or not. The design of the signal generator and the detector are thoroughly discussed, and an example based on a quadruple-tank process is used to show the application and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Further, the real-time requirements of CPS applications require CPSs to respond quickly and the aggregation method that is long-established in CPSs makes it challenging to ascertain the value of the original data. Thus, a systematic approach is essential to accomplish the goal of faulty data detection and filtering. In this paper, we present several approaches that we can deploy to detect and filter faulty data efficiently and cost-effectively, to improve the quality of the collected data from a system’s perspective to match the specific requirements of CPSs."

The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input–output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of T-detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies T-detectability property for a finite T, this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems."

With replay attacks, attacker records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and output, respectively. Moreover, the output-based detector has more low-computing solution process than the residual-based one. Finally, a practical example is proposed to demonstrate the superiority of the stochastic coding scheme."

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be a vital part of CPS as strong sensing capabilities can be one of the major driving factors for CPS applications. Still CPS is considered as a nascent technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These challenges are often posed due to the complexity of communication, computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living, environmental control and traffic management. Unfortunately, no unified architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations among the applications. In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few CPS healthcare architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all lack of efficient false alarm detection. In this paper, a novel false alarm detection architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare applications."

As a result, it is of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper, from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs. First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective. Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally, some challenge issues are raised for the future research."

The network and physical system dynamics will become stochastic and uncertain due to packet losses and random delays from the network. Moreover, the overall NCS can become unstable with an increase in delays and packet losses due to attacks. In this chapter, both cyber- (or network) and physical system dynamics of an NCS are considered linear initially and then nonlinear. In both cases, by using a state-space representation of the communication network, controllers are designed to stabilize the traffic flow in the network and the NCS by using Q-learning in the case of a linear NCS and neural networks in the case of a nonlinear NCS. The attack detection and estimation are accomplished by using residual signals that are generated from novel adaptive observers. Also, the detectability conditions are derived and the maximum delay and packet loss bound are given before the NCS becomes unstable. Simulation results are given."

The proposed modified NPE can not only extract local information effectively on data manifold of the ICPS but also solve the singularity problem caused by generalized eigenvalue decomposition skills. Additional advantages of this design for ICPSs include the enhanced fault detectability, inherent scalability, and accelerated computation efficiency.

In fact, when a production system is attacked, the manufactured output before the attack does not have to be discarded if exact time of the attack is found.

abstract = "Industrial Cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), integrating communication, computation and control of industrial processes are referred to as a core technology to approach the Industry 4.0. Ensuring the ICPS security is of paramount importance in smart manufacturing. Considering the characteristics of large-scale, geographically-dispersed and multi-dimensional heterogeneous, federated and life-critical natures of ICPSs, this paper investigates a hierarchically distributed intrusion detection scheme that seeks to achieve the all-round safety protection of ICPSs according to the system structure and attacking types of each ICPS layer. For physical system-relevant perceptual executive layer, potential and covert attacks are detected by the clustered sensory system state residual anomaly monitoring based on a process noise and measurement noise-adaptive Kalman filter (PNMN-AKF). PNMN-AKF can perform a joint recursive estimation of dynamic system states, time-varying process and measurement noise covariance matrices by the variational Bayes approximation framework. In cyberspace, potential cyber-attacks are detected by the anomaly monitoring of the statistical distribution of the network transmission characteristics of data transmission layer by introducing a forgetting factor-induced recursive Gaussian mixture model (FF-RGMM). In the application control layer, a regularized sparse deep belief network model is introduced to characterize the misuse behavior for detecting potential attacks. Extensive validation and comparative experiments have been conducted on a numerical simulation system and a comprehensive ICPS simulation platform by using OPNET and a commonly-used benchmark simplified Tennessee Eastman process (STEP) based on Matlab/Simulink. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically distributed intrusion detection method can efficiently recognize potential and covert cyber-attacks in each ICPSs link with low false alarm rate and missing detection rate, which lays a foundation for the overall security monitoring of ICPSs."

abstract = "We study the problem of detecting an attack on a stochastic cyber-physical system. We start by proposing a detection criterion based on checking the statistics of the Kalman prediction error. To show the importance of the proposed criterion, we study certain attacking schemes which can be effectively detected by this criterion, but not by checking simpler conditions based on commonly used statistics. We then use the proposed criterion to derive a detection algorithm. This algorithm is based on a statistical confidence test, giving a confidence level for detecting an attack. We present simulation results to illustrate the performance of this algorithm."

abstract = "We consider periodic watermarking scheduling for detecting discontinuous replay attacks in Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs). The existing methods of imposing continuous watermarks on the nominal control inputs may result in the waste of control cost when system detectors are not sensitive to the added watermarks, since the attacker may be absent for a considerably long time. For example, in the famous Stuxnet event, the attacker only launches the attack for a short period each month in order to avoid being detected. In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Both complexes demonstrate stability and strong characteristic luminescence emissions in organic and water media. They also possess excellent luminescence sensing activities toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72−/CrO42− in DMF and aqueous solutions as well as simulated biological system. Notably, Tb-CP is one of the very few examples to effectively distinguish between CrO42− and Cr2O72− in aqueous and HEPES media. Both CPs could be simply and quickly regenerated at least five circles. The research on sensing mechanism indicated that the luminescence quenching may be related with the energy competition and weak interactions between CPs and sensing analytes."

In this study, we elucidated a novel, facile, and highly selective Chemo-Paper-Sensor (CPS) for detection and monitoring of strontium (Sr2+) ions, which means a potent colorimetric sensor based on a Chrysoidine G (CG)-coated paper strip. The CPS for highly selective colorimetric detection of strontium ion was handily analyzed to determine the red-green-blue (RGB) value using portable devices such as desktop digital scanner and mobile phone camera, quantitatively. Interestingly, an orange to dark orange color transition was observed when the aqueous and solid paper colorimetric sensor was introduced to Sr2+ ion, respectively. It was demonstrated that the value of the signal has a linear relationship with concentrations of the strontium in the 500 ppm to 100 ppb range with a detection limit of 200 ppb. We believe that a newly developed Chemo-Paper-Sensor will be useful in a wide range of sensing applications."

Luminescent spectra demonstrate that CPs 1–7 exhibit impressive UV–visible luminescence in the solid state at room temperature. More significantly, a single-component white-light material with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of (0.335, 0.334) for 4 (Sm-CP), very closing to the pure white-light of (0.333, 0.333) was obtained by finely tuning of the excitation wavelength. In addition, the luminescent detection for anions of 7 is investigated. Fluorescence measurements show that 7 can detect oxoanion pollutants Cr2O72−, CrO42−, and MnO4− anions in aqueous solutions with high selectivity and sensitivity, which suggests that the Tb-CP is a promising functional luminescence probe for toxic oxoanions. The possible mechanisms of the quenching effect were also discussed in detail."
