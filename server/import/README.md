# A small tutorial

This folder only has example code, it works but not perfectly well.

First, server has to be running for this code to work, I'm trying to find other solutions, but atm that is how it has to be.

Second, use the readbib.js, the read.js file is only for a xlsx import i tried. 

Third, yes, readbib.js should be a module in its own file, I'll do that when I have time.
