Development in coordination polymers (CPs) provides a great platform for tracing hazardous substance by fluorescence detection. In this work, two novel Zn-CPs, namely [Zn(1,1′-bbi)(C2O4)]n (1) and [Zn3(1,1′-bbi)(L)2(H2O)]n (2) (flexible 1,1′-bbi = 1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole), and H3L = 5-(2-carboxylphenoxy)isophthalic acid) have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions, and further characterized by IR spectra, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric (TG) analyses, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 displays a sql topological framework; complex 2 shows an unprecedented 4-nodal (3,3,5,6)-c topological network with Point Schläfli symbol (4·5·6)2(42·52·62·73·9)2(42·52·64·7·84·9·10)(42·5)2.

abstract={Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is a typical Cyber Physical System (CPS) application for human-computer interaction. In the process of vehicle driving, we use the information from CPS on ADAS to not only help us understand the driving condition of the car but also help us change the driving strategies to drive in a better and safer way. After getting the information, the driver can evaluate the feedback information of the vehicle, so as to enhance the ability to assist in driving of the ADAS system. This completes a complete human-computer interaction process. However, the data obtained during the interaction usually form a large dimension, and irrelevant features sometimes hide the occurrence of anomalies, which poses a significant challenge to us to better understand the driving states of the car. To solve this problem, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on RBM-LSTM. In this hybrid framework, RBM is trained to extract general underlying features from data collected by CPS, and LSTM is trained from the features learned by RBM. This framework can effectively improve the prediction speed and present a good prediction accuracy to show vehicle driving condition. Besides, drivers are allowed to evaluate the prediction results, so as to improve the accuracy of prediction. Through the experimental results, we can find that the proposed framework not only simplifies the training of the entire neural network and increases the training speed but also greatly improves the accuracy of the interaction-driven data analysis. It is a valid method to analyze the data generated during the human interaction. © 2020 ACM.},

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that all CPs featured a two dimensional (2D) layer with (6, 6, 6)-connected 63 topology. Luminescent spectra demonstrate that CPs 1–7 exhibit impressive UV–visible luminescence in the solid state at room temperature. More significantly, a single-component white-light material with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of (0.335, 0.334) for 4 (Sm-CP), very closing to the pure white-light of (0.333, 0.333) was obtained by finely tuning of the excitation wavelength. In addition, the luminescent detection for anions of 7 is investigated. Fluorescence measurements show that 7 can detect oxoanion pollutants Cr2O7 2 −, CrO4 2 −, and MnO4 − anions in aqueous solutions with high selectivity and sensitivity, which suggests that the Tb-CP is a promising functional luminescence probe for toxic oxoanions.

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are more vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks than the conventional systems because of the tight integration of the cyber, communication and control aspects of CPS. Deceptive attacks are very severe on such systems because they go undetected when classical detectors like chi-squared detector is used. Once such deceptive attack that we focus in this paper are false data injection attacks, where the attacker inputs carefully designed false attack vectors. Chi-square detector which detects based on the statistics of deviations of the residual i.e. difference of observed measurement and estimated measurement fails to detect these attacks, since the statistics is not changed in these attacks. 'Cosine similarity detector' was proposed to detect False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in smart grid scenario. However, we show that there exists attack vectors that remain stealthy to both chi-square as well as the cosine-square detectors. We propose an random coding scheme to modify the measurements at random, unknown to the attacker while known to the estimator. We establish that our coding scheme in conjunction with the cosine similarity detector provides promising detection performance. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel improved coherently integrated cubic phase function (ICI-CPF) algorithm is proposed for the cubic phase signal (CPS). The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. Firstly, transform the CPS to the lag-frequency domain, in which auto-terms are concentrated into straight lines passing through the origin of the two-dimensional plane. Based on this important property, the auto-terms are coherently accumulated along the straight lines. Finally, search the distinct peaks in the chirp rate (CR)-quadratic chirp rate (QCR) domain, and estimate the CR and QCR, simultaneously. ICICPF algorithm can be proved to be with well auto-term accumulation and cross-term suppression capabilities by theory analysis and simulations. Besides, compared with several existing algorithms, it shows superior anti-noise performance and acceptable computation complexity. Based on ICICPF algorithm, a novel multi-component CPS detection method is presented, which is able to eliminate the shadow effect among the components and realize the components detection. Simulations and real measured data processing results proves its validity. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical infrastructure networks from powerdistribution to utility networks. The emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,we introduce a novel and configurable systemlevel framework to identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral characteristics.We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include accuracy values between 95% and 99% for the different attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

abstract={In long-term evolution (LTE) systems, there is an option to extend the size of the cyclic-prefix (CP) when the propagation environment is characterized by severe time dispersion. Such a peculiar feature makes the system more resilient against multipath distortions, but inevitably complicates the downlink synchronization task, which cannot be accomplished through conventional techniques devised for a specified CP size. In this paper, we study the problem of CP length detection in the LTE downlink in the presence of a timing uncertainty and frequency offset. In contrast to previous investigations based on heuristic arguments, our approach relies on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation criterion. Furthermore, it accounts for the irregular LTE symbol (characterized by a different CP size), which is present in the normal CP operation mode. The resulting scheme operates in the time-domain and computes a different metric for each possible position of the irregular symbol within the observation window. Due to its flexibility, the proposed ML approach can be applied to any future multicarrier standard for the design of a CP length detection algorithm, either in the presence or in the absence of irregular symbols. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can execute illegal operations within the normal network communication defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work, we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state. We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection rules. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are next-generation intelligent systems based on environment-aware computing, communication, and physical elements. They are widely used in security-critical systems and industrial control. The interaction of information technology and the physical world makes CPS vulnerable to various malicious attacks, thereby undermining its security. This work mainly studies the attack detection problem of sensors in CPS systems with transient faults. This study considers a system with multiple sensors measuring the same physical variables, and some sensors may be malicious attacked and provide erroneous measurements. In addition, this study uses an abstract sensor model where each sensor provides the controller with an interval of possible values for the true value. Existing methods for detecting sensor malicious attacks are conservative. When a professional attacker manipulates the sensor's output slightly or infrequently over a period of time, existing methods are difficult to capture attacks, such as stealth attacks. In order to solve this problem, this study designs a sensor attack detection algorithm based on fusion intervals and historical measurements. First, the algorithm constructs different fault models for different sensors, integrates historical measurements into the attack detection method using system dynamics equations, and analyzes sensor measurements from different aspects. In addition, combined with historical measurement and fusion interval, the problem of whether there are faults when the two sensors intersect is solved. The core idea of this method is to detect and identify attack by using pairwise inconsistency between sensors. This study obtains real measurement data from EV3 ground vehicles to verify the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithm, and has better detection and recognition performance for various attack types. Especially for stealth attacks, the detection rate and recognition rate are increased by more than 90%. © Copyright 2019, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) has achieved good results in object detection but there are problems such as insufficient understanding of context information and loss of features in deep layers. In order to alleviate these problems, we propose a single-shot object detection network Context Perception-SSD (CP-SSD). CP-SSD promotes the network's understanding of context information by using context information scene perception modules, so as to capture context information for objects of different scales. Deep layer feature map used semantic activation module, through self-supervised learning to adjust the context feature information and channel interdependence, and enhance useful semantic information. CP-SSD was validated on benchmark dataset PASCAL VOC 2007. The experimental results show that, compared with SSD, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the CP-SSD detection method reaches 77.8%, which is 0.6% higher than that of SSD, and the detection effect was significantly improved in images with difficult to distinguish the object from the background. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Sulfur mustard (HD) reacts with human serum albumin (HSA) at Cys34 and produces a long-term biomarker of HD exposure. Here, we present a novel, sensitive, and convenient method for quantification of HD exposure by detection of HD-HSA adducts using pronase digestion, benzyl chloroformate (Cbz-Cl) derivatization, and ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The HSA in HD-exposed plasma in vitro was precipitated with acetone and digested (2 h, 50 °C) with pronase to form the alkylated dipeptide, S-hydroxyethylthioethyl-CysPro (HETE-CP). The HETE-CP adduct was derivatized with Cbz-Cl to generate N-carbobenzoxy HETE-CP (HETE-C(Cbz)P). The derivatized product was analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. HD surrogate, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (2-CEES), was introduced as a non-isotope internal standard (ISTD) instead of traditional d8-HD for quantification. The method was found to be linear between 1.00 and 200 ng/mL HD exposure (R2 &gt; 0.998) with precision of ≤ 9.0% relative standard deviation (RSD) and accuracy ranged between 97.1 and 111%. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.500 ng/mL (S/N~5), over 15 times lower than that of the previous method (7.95 ng/mL). Time-consuming affinity purification or solid phase extraction (SPE) is not needed in the experiment and the operation takes less than 5 h. This study provides a new strategy and useful tool for retrospective analysis of HD exposure by HETE-CP biomarker detection.

This method leverages features specific to CP-ABE in order to improve the detection capabilities of the IDS and the response ability of the network. It also enables improved privacy towards the users through group encryption rather than one-to-one shared key encryption as the policies used in the CP-ABE can easily include the IDS as an authorized reader. More importantly, it enables different levels of detection and response to intrusions, which can be crucial when using anomaly-based detection engines. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigate direct detection signatures of dark matter particles interacting with quarks via a light spin-0 mediator with general CP phases. Since tree-level scattering may be strongly suppressed in the non-relativistic limit, loop contributions play an important role and can lead to observable signals in near-future experiments. We study the phenomenology of different mediator masses and CP phases with an emphasis on scenarios with maximal CP violation and Higgs portal models. Intriguingly, the sum of the rates obtained at tree- and loop-level can give a characteristic recoil spectrum not obtainable from a single type of interaction. We furthermore develop a novel method for decomposing the two-loop contribution to effective interactions between dark matter and gluons into two separate one-loop diagrams, which in our case substantially simplifies the calculation of the important top-quark contribution. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a next-generation intelligent system integrating computing, communication, and control. As a unit of computing process and physical process, CPS is a new research field, where cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is not only a microcosm of CPS but also a prerequisite for unmanned systems. CACC relies on the wireless communication network technology to achieve cooperative platooning control through vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative control methods. It can improve traffic efficiency and ensure safe driving. Once the wireless network is introduced by each vehicle to exchange information, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks, making attack detection necessary. In this paper, an integral sliding mode observer is designed to monitor malicious attacks. The proposed sliding mode observer not only retains the performance of traditional sliding mode control but also realizes the finite-time observation, avoiding the singular phenomenon that may occur in the traditional terminal sliding mode. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={The development of quick and effective strategies for the removal of organic dyes and the detection of metal ions in aqueous solutions remains a challenge for protecting the public health and environment. Multifunctional materials that combine both the dye-adsorption and pollutant-detection functions rarely have been explored. In this work, a 2D Tb(III) coordination polymer (Tb-CP) was directly assembled on the Zr(IV)-based UiO-66-NH2 matrix through covalent grafting, resulting in the new hybrid UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP material. Benefiting from the porous structure of the parent UiO-66-NH2 matrix, the unique luminescent signal of Tb-CP, and the good structure and solvent stability, the fabricated UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP material features a great potential for several cycles of absorption and release of organic dyes. Given the presence of Tb-CP, the resulting surface of UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP has more positive charge exposing active sites and exhibits a particularly high and quick absorption (397.31 mg·g-1) of the Coomassie brilliant blue (R250) organic dye in aqueous solution, along with the fast desorption ability. More significantly, after absorption and desorption of different organic dyes, UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP can be further used for detecting Cu2+ or Ce3+ ions via Tb(III) luminescence quenching. All processes from the absorption and desorption of organic dyes to the detection of metal ions are reversible, are efficient, and fit a requirement for new sustainable materials. The excellent performance of UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP benefits from a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of UiO-66-NH2 as well as a strong interaction between the two components of this hybrid material. "Tea bag" experiments further confirmed the efficiency and simplicity of the practical application of UiO-66-NH2@Tb-CP for the adsorption and desorption of the R250 dye, which can be monitored by the naked eye. The present work thus represents a unique example of the hybrid, covalently bound MOF-based material that can simultaneously be used as the sustainable and easily recoverable absorption material for toxic dyes and the luminescent probe for the quantitative recognition of metal cations in aqueous solutions. The present study provides new perspectives for the design of multifunctional MOF-based materials for applications in sustainable chemistry. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A large number of studies have provided datasets in the field of CPS security research, but the rate of actually using these datasets is low. It is difficult to objectively compare and analyze research results based on different testbeds or datasets. Our goal is to create public datasets for CPS security researchers working for anomaly detection. It is challenging for individuals to collect long-term datasets repeatedly for a large number of scenarios. This can lead to mistakes and inaccurate information. The process of collection must be comfortable and automated. For this purpose, we constructed a testbed in which three physical control systems (GE turbine, Emerson boiler, and FESTO water treatment system) can be combined with each other through the dSPACE Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator. We have built an environment that can automatically control each sensor and control point remotely. Using this environment, it is possible to collect datasets while repeatedly driving a large number of benign/malicious scenarios for a long period while minimizing human effort. We will develop and release CPS datasets using the testbed in the future. © 2019 USENIX Association. All rights reserved.},

Topology analysis indicated that compound 1 showed a 3D lvt topology, whereas compound 2 showed a two-fold interpenetrated 3D diamond network. Complexes 3 and 4 exhibited 2D sql/Shubnikov tetragonal plane networks. The coordination polymers were distinguished by the 5-substituted groups of isophthalate and the conformation of bpp. Moreover, compounds 2-4 are bifunctional luminescent materials that can detect environmentally relevant Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions using a luminescence quenching method. The detection limits of CPs 2-4 for Fe3+ were 6.676 × 10-5 M, 5.442 × 10-5 M, and 1.773 × 10-5 M, respectively, whereas the detection limits of CPs 2-4 for Cr2O72- were 0.1314 × 10-5 M, 1.778 × 10-5 M, and 1.676 × 10-5 M, respectively.

abstract={Two new signal-based and one model-based fault detection methods using canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition algorithms are presented, and application examples of heating systems are given for all methods. The first signal-based fault detection method uses the factor matrices of a data tensor directly, the second calculates expected values from the decomposed tensor and compares these with measured values to generate the residuals. The third fault detection method is based on multi-linear models represented by parameter tensors with elements computed by subspace parameter identification algorithms and data for different but structured operating regimes. In case of missing data or model parameters in tensor representation, an approximation method based on a special CP tensor decomposition algorithm for incomplete tensors is proposed, called the decompose-and-unfold method. As long as all relevant dynamics has been recorded, this method approximates – also from incomplete data – models for all operating regimes, which can be used for residual generation and fault detection, e.g. by parity equations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Introduction Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood physical disability, with 80%estimated to be in low-middle-income countries. This study aims to (1) determine the accuracy of General Movements (GMs)/Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) for detecting CP at 18 months corrected age (CA); (2) determine the effectiveness of a community-based parent-delivered early intervention for infants at high risk of CP in West Bengal, India (Learning through Everyday Activities with Parents for infants with CP; LEAP-CP). Methods This study comprises two substudies: (1) a study of the predictive validity of the GMs and HINE for detecting CP; (2) randomised, double-blinded controlled trial of a novel intervention delivered through peer trainers (Community Disability Workers, CDW) compared with health advice (15 fortnightly visits). 142 infants at high risk of CP ('absent fidgety' GMs; 'high risk score' on HINE) aged 12-40 weeks CA will be recruited to the intervention substudy, with infants randomised based on a computer-generated sequence. Researchers will be masked to group allocation, and caregivers and CDWs naïve to intervention status. Visits will include therapeutic modules (goal-directed active motor/cognitive strategies and LEAP-CP games) and parent education. Health advice is based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, WHO. Infants will be evaluated at baseline, post intervention and 18 months CA. The primary hypothesis is that infants receiving LEAP-CP will have greater scaled scores on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (mobility domain) at 18 months compared with health advice. Secondary outcomes include infant functional motor, cognitive, visual and communication development; infant growth; maternal mental health. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved through appropriate Australian and Indian ethics committees (see in text) with families providing written informed consent. Findings from this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications and conference presentations.

abstract={Two novel luminescent cadmium coordination polymers (Cd-CPs), [Cd(TPA)(DIB)]n (1) and [Cd(TPA)(BIYB)]n (2), have been successfully designed and synthesized using Cd2+, deprotonated 3,3′-thiodipropionic acid (H2TPA), and 4,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl (BIYB) or 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzene (DIB). CP 1 has a 3D structure with a new topology. CP 2 possesses a double layer 2D structure with two types of 1D tunnel. The fluorescence property application and mechanisms of the two Cd-CPs for detecting Hg2+, Cr2O72−, nitrobenzene (NB), or 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) have been researched. CPs 1-2 demonstrate good chemical stability, high sensitivity and selective responsive detection of Hg2+, Cr2O72−, NB, or 2,4-DNP. The high quenching percentages in dilute aqueous solutions were 98.5% (Hg2+, 1), 96.2% (Hg2+, 2), 98.5% (Cr2O72−, 1), 96.4% (Cr2O72−, 2), 99.6% (NB, 1) and 99.2% (2,4-DNP, 2). The detection limits were 2.1 × 10−7 (Hg2+, 1), 1.1 × 10−6 (Cr2O72−, 1), 2.7 × 10−7 (NB, 1), 1.9 × 10−7 (Hg2+, 2), 2.4 × 10−7 (Cr2O72−, 2), and 1.3 × 10−7 (2,4-DNP, 2) and are similar to the permissible limits set by the USEPA. The mechanism of Hg2+ luminescence quenching involves an interaction with the free thio sites of the CPs. The Cr2O72−, NB, and 2,4-DNP quenching mechanism involves the overlap of the absorption bands of the recognition materials with the excitation or emission bands of CPs 1-2. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best examples of CPs as probes for sensing Hg2+, Cr2O72−, NB, or 2,4-DNP. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

abstract={Daytime short nap involves physiological processes, such as alertness, drowsiness and sleep. The study of the relationship between drowsiness and nap based on physiological signals is a great way to have a better understanding of the periodical rhymes of physiological states. A model of Bayesian nonnegative CP decomposition (BNCPD) was proposed to extract common multiway features from the group-level electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. As an extension of the nonnegative CP decomposition, the BNCPD model involves prior distributions of factor matrices, while the underlying CP rank could be determined automatically based on a Bayesian nonparametric approach. In terms of computational speed, variational inference was applied to approximate the posterior distributions of unknowns. Extensive simulations on the synthetic data illustrated the capability of our model to recover the true CP rank. As a real-world application, the performance of drowsiness detection during daytime short nap by using the BNCPD-based features was compared with that of other traditional feature extraction methods. Experimental results indicated that the BNCPD model outperformed other methods for feature extraction in terms of two evaluation metrics, as well as different parameter settings. Our approach is likely to be a useful tool for automatic CP rank determination and offering a plausible multiway physiological information of individual states. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents study results regarding the analytical method for performance characteristics and application scheme, which cover a feature detection scheme using a Cyclic Prefix (CP) that is attached to an OFDM signal. The detection scheme is especially important when used as a sensing technology in advanced systems such as Deviceto- Device (D-to-D) or Internet of Things (IoT). Herein, we present several basic performance characteristics of the signal processing involved in feature detection, namely, the Output S/N (Signal-to-Noise power ratio) and probability density functions of the OFDM signal and the noise measured at the output of the feature detector. The Output S/Nis described by an analytical expression and is also examined by conducting a software simulation. An analytical approach is investigated by modeling the spectral density of the OFDM signal and input noise and by executing the mathematical operations such as convolutional integration on the combination of OFDM signal and noise. The analytical results coincide closely with the simulation results. As for the applications to mobile communication system, some methods of the feature detection schemes are addressed. These are an estimation method for the Input C/N (Carrier-to-Noise power ratio) and a system discrimination scheme, especially under the assumption that two OFDM systems using different CP lengths are simultaneously operated in the same frequency. Furthermore, under the condition that two OFDM signals are transmitted in an asynchronous manner, a scheme to estimate their timing offset and signal power ratio is also described. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

abstract={Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition, our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding anomalies, but there is still room for improvement. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The 2D Detection subsection of the Experiments and Results section should be replaced with the following text: Fig. 17 shows a set of intermediate results for excavator detection in the cascading process. The detecting process followed the matching order of key nodes. First, five possible boom regions in the blue rectangles were detected. Then the template of the stick was attached to these five regions respectively, and only three possible sticks labeled by three vertical narrow rectangles in cyan color were kept as the candidate sticks for further detection of the bucket. Finally, the template of the bucket was attached to the three sticks and only one bucket labeled by a small rectangular box in red color was detected. By concatenating all three templates accordingly based on the matching order of the key nodes, the excavator was detected finally without mismatching. To assess the effect of the number of component templates on the detection rate, ROC curves for the detection of individual components in Data Set 2 were generated (Fig. 18). Solid lines indicate the detection results using two templates for each component, while dashed lines show the results using only one template. The detection rate of using two templates is higher than that of using one template. The result is as expected because in Data Set 2, the excavator swung over 90°, and one template does not cover the swing range. The reference of Bummbummkarl (2014) included the wrong URL.

abstract={Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an important clinical problem of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which incurs approximately 90% of all TBI-related costs. However, current detection approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria, paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First, a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria. With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and provide timely decision supports. Evaluations on 107 clinical cases extracted from medical publications demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our integrated system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Devices that monitor and measure various system parameters or physical phenomena form an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Such devices usually operate continuously and gather important data that is often critical for the operation of the underlying system. Thus, it becomes important to understand and detect abnormal or malicious device behavior, false injection of data by an adversary, or other security threats that may lead to incorrect measurement data. This paper addresses the problem of detection of anomalies in diurnal traffic volume data in an intelligent transportation system. The proposed approach leverages the statistical properties of the data to perform anomaly detection by calculating the 'local density' of the data points. Anomalous behavior in the traffic volumes reported by road segments is calculated based on sparse local density of the data points. Our approach for detecting anomalies does not require any information about the outside factors which might have influenced the data. The proposed approach has been evaluated on attacks simulated on transportation data collected by the New York State Department of Transportation. The proposed approach also extends to other cyber-physical systems where the monitored data exhibits diurnal patterns. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is proving to be a useful tool for characterization and quantification of metallic nanoparticles. However, the short (200-400 μs) transient signals generated by single particle events have to date presented challenges to current instrumentation and methodologies. Minimum dwell times are available commercially at 50-100 μs timings but limitations in sensitivity for quadrupole ICP-MS make analysis of particles below 10 nm diameter difficult. A further limitation of ICP-MS when using smaller dwell times is the available dynamic range. Typically, a simultaneous detector as used with most ICP-MS has a maximum count ceiling of ∼3 × 106 cps which equates to only 150 counts for a 50 μs dwell. This work will present data acquired on a magnetic sector ICP-MS with GHz ppm-1 sensitivities using dwell times down to 10 μs and requiring no hardware modifications. This work will demonstrate the advantages obtained with the ability to measure fast transient signals with count rates in excess of 3 × 107 cps. A further range extension facility based on physical attenuation of the ion beam will be demonstrated which allows the same faster dwell times to be used for signals in excess of 1 × 109 cps. A novel data processing technique will be described, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous techniques when fixed particle signal widths and compliance with ideal Poisson statistics for error correction have been assumed. Data will be presented to show the non-ideal behaviour of ion cloud signals from nano-particles and the measurable impact of these behaviours on the calculations. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Chemosensors have attracted increasing attention for their usefulness on-site detection and monitoring. In this study, we elucidated a novel, facile, and highly selective Chemo-Paper-Sensor (CPS) for detection and monitoring of strontium (Sr2+) ions, which means a potent colorimetric sensor based on a Chrysoidine G (CG)-coated paper strip. The CPS for highly selective colorimetric detection of strontium ion was handily analyzed to determine the red-green-blue (RGB) value using portable devices such as desktop digital scanner and mobile phone camera, quantitatively. Interestingly, an orange to dark orange color transition was observed when the aqueous and solid paper colorimetric sensor was introduced to Sr2+ ion, respectively. It was demonstrated that the value of the signal has a linear relationship with concentrations of the strontium in the 500 ppm to 100 ppb range with a detection limit of 200 ppb. We believe that a newly developed Chemo-Paper-Sensor will be useful in a wide range of sensing applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We introduce a simple scenario involving fermionic dark matter (χ) and singlet scalar mediators that may account for the Galactic center GeV γ-ray excess while satisfying present direct detection constraints. CP violation in the scalar potential leads to a mixing between the Standard Model Higgs boson and the scalar singlet, resulting in three scalars, h1,2,3, of indefinite CP-transformation properties. This mixing enables s-wave χχ annihilation into discalar states, followed by decays into four-fermion final states. The observed γ-ray spectrum can be fitted while respecting present direct detection bounds and Higgs boson properties for mχ=60∼80 GeV, and mh3∼mχ. Searches for the Higgs exotic decay channel h1→h3h3 at the 14 TeV LHC should be able to further probe the parameter region favored by the γ-ray excess. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

In order to exploit the full potential of the decomposition, a fault detection algorithm that is applicable to the decomposed tensor structure is defined.

abstract={Enormous economic losses caused by infection of peppers with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) have spurred the development of CMV-resistant peppers using genetic techniques. However, growing concern from the general public over genetically modified (GM) crops has focused attention on safety and labeling issues. In this study, we developed and optimized a qualitative and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect CMV-resistant GM peppers. Two types of antibodies, virion-derived polyclonal antibody (VPAb) prepared from a CMV-Fny virion-immunized rabbit and peptide-based polyclonal antibody (PPAb) prepared from rabbits immunized with a peptide fragment of CMVcoat protein (CMV-CP) (LPDSVTEYDKKLVSR) predicted from the nucleotide sequence were prepared, and their affinities were compared. Optimized ELISAs using VPAb and PPAb as the primary antibodies, respectively, were carried out to measure the level of CMV-CP in GM peppers cultivated at an officially approved facility in Korea. Color development (reflecting CMV-CP levels) was 2.5-fold higher when PPAb was used as the primary antibody compared to VPAb as the primary antibody. No statistical differences were observed among GM pepper cultivars. These results imply that PPAb has higher specificity for CMV-CP than VPAb does, and that the analytical system presented in this study can be used to evaluate the level of CMV-CP in genetically modified peppers. © 2015, Korean Society for Horticultural Science and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

The proposed DFT structure uses the existing circuit units as one part of test device in the test mode. It can be easily implemented with several logic gates. The test circuit is all digital. It avoids the need of interfacing any foreign component and decreases the test cost of whole IC. Moreover, the proposed structure only needs a minor modification of the digital part in CP-PLL avoiding the loading effect at analog node.

abstract={White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is an important pasture legume in temperate areas throughout the world, providing fodder for grazing animals and improving soil fertility via symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, the persistence and stress tolerance of white clover is affected by several viruses, chiefly Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV) and White clover mosaic virus (WClMV). Efforts to introgress natural forms of virus resistance from other Trifolium spp. into white clover and lucerne (alfalfa) have had only limited success. This has been addressed by developing white clover germplasm exhibiting viral-coat-protein-mediated resistance to AMV and non-transgenic resistance to ClYVV. This report describes PCR-based assays for detecting the transgenes associated with the H6 transformation event in seeds, fresh leaves, air-dried leaves and mixtures of air-dried herbage of white clover and perennial ryegrass (hay). Although further development is required to convert these assays for use in the field, this paper demonstrates the ability to detect these transgenes in a range of agricultural products associated with the commercial use of white clover. © 2015 CSIRO.},

abstract={Purpose: While MS is a powerful tool for biomarker determinations, the high salt content and the small molecules present in urine poses incredible challenges. Separation/extraction methods must be employed for the isolation of target species at relevant concentrations. Micropipette tips packed with capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are employed for the SPE of proteins from a synthetic and a certified urine matrix. Experimental design: Extractions are performed utilizing a very simple centrifugation method to spin-down species through the C-CP fiber tips. Proteins adsorb to the hydrophobic polypropylene fibers and are eluted in a solvent suitable for MALDI-MS analysis. Figures of merit are determined for representative compounds β2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein, and transferrin. Results: The optimum protein processing included a 100 μL aqueous rinse and an elution solvent composition was 10 μL of 55:45 ACN:water (with triflouroacetic acid). MALDI-MS responses for the target proteins are improved from nondetectable levels to eventually yield LOD ranging from 5 to 180 nM in 1 μL aliquots. Conclusion and clinical relevance: C-CP fiber tips offer a plethora of advantages including low materials costs, high throughput, microvolume processing, and the determination of sub-nanogram quantities of analyte; allowing determination of biomarkers that are otherwise undetectable in urine matrices. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The albumin adduct formed in human plasma in vitro (HETE bound to the side chain of cysteine 34) was isolated and cleaved by current lots of pronase primarily generating the internal modified dipeptide (HETE-cysteine-proline, HETE-CP) instead of the formerly reported HETE-CPF tripeptide. The analyte was detected by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS). In principle, HETE-CP undergoes a dynamic on-column equilibrium of cis-trans isomerism thus requiring separation at 50°C to obtain one narrow peak. Accordingly, we developed both a novel longer lasting but more sensitive microbore (1 mm i.d., flow 30 μL/min, cycle time 60 min, LOD 50 nM) and a faster, less sensitive narrowbore (2.1 mm i.d., 200 μL/min, cycle time 16min, LOD 100 nM, both on Atlantis T3 material at 50°C) LC-ESI-MS-MS method suitable for verification analysis. The corresponding tri-and tetrapeptide, Q(HETE)-CPF were monitored simultaneously. HETE-CP peak areas were directly proportional to SM concentrations added to plasma in vitro (0.05-100 μM). Albumin adducts formed by deuterated SM (d8-SM) served as internal standard. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={There are no current commercial releases of genetically modified white clover, but several research groups are working on traits such as virus resistance, stress tolerance and bloat safety that are likely to provide large economic benefits for livestock farmers. However, white clover pollen is a common constituent of honey produced by bees foraging white clover flowers. Therefore, there is a need to develop tools to detect the presence of genetically modified pollen in white clover honey. The results presented in this paper describe the development and application of PCR-based techniques to detect the Alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein gene (AMV CP) and the neomycin phosphotransferase 2 selectable marker gene (npt2) in genetically modified white clover pollen, whether this pollen is collected fresh, from honey bees that have been foraging white clover, or from honey. Further research and development will be required to develop 'field-ready' tools for the detection and quantification of these transgenes in pollen and honey products. However, this paper demonstrates prospects and principles in pollen and honey from honeybees foraging transgenic white clover. © CSIRO 2015.},

This work presents a set of mechanisms for timebased intrusion detection, i.e., the execution of unauthorized instructions in realtime CPS environments. The novelty is the utilization of information obtained by static timing analysis for intrusion detection. Real-time CPS systems are unique in that timing bounds on code sections are readily available since they are required for schedulability analysis.We demonstrate how micro-timings can be exploited for multiple granularity levels of application code to track execution progress. Through bounds checking of these micro-timings, we develop techniques to detect intrusions (1) in a self-checking manner by the application and (2) through the operating system scheduler, which are novel contributions to the real-time/embedded systems domain to the best of our knowledge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Introduction: A Common Primer Multiplex PCR (CP-M-PCR) was developed to detect three groups of animal species (swine, ruminant and pseudo-ruminant) from meat-based products. This method demonstrated a higher sensitivity and efficiency than the conventional multiplex PCR. Objective: To develop a highly sensitive multiplex PCR method for rapid and accurate identification of meat in meat-based products. Methods: In this study, a common forward primer was designed at a homologous region of mitochondrial NADH-dehyrogenase subunit 4 (Nad 4) gene sequences of all the animal groups. Adapter reverse primers were designed by adding an adapter sequence at the 5'-end of the specific reverse primers. PCR were performed on DNA extracted from muscle tissue samples using a common forward primer, adapter reverse primers and an adapter primer targeting sequence of Nad 4 gene. A serial of dilution of each reverse primer was used to determine and compare the sensitivity of CP-M-PCR to conventional multiplex PCR system. The detection limit of CP-M-PCR was evaluated with 10-fold serial dilutions of DNA concentration mixture in different ratios of concentration. Results & Discussion: The use of adapter sequence at the 5'-end of the reverse primers increased the efficiency of the amplification and the application of a single forward primer solved the complexity in multiplex PCR system. Bands of specific amplification can be detected from the PCR assays containing as low as 10-6 μM of adapter reverse primer. This result indicated the sensitivity was tremendously increased as compared to the conventional multiplex PCR (10-3 μM). The limit of detection was as low as 1 ng of DNA. Conclusion: CP-M-PCR has greatly improved the sensitivity and efficiency of the PCR system for detecting fraud in meat-based products, resulting in more reliable and accurate results than conventional multiplex PCR system. © 2014 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.},

Specifically, it employs KT to correct the effect of the range migration. Then, the estimates of the acceleration and jerk with CPF are obtained to compensate Doppler frequency migration. Finally, Fourier Transform (FT) is conducted to integrate coherently the target returns. Compared with the third-order RFT algorithm [8, 10], the proposed method can avoid the problem of blind speed lobe (BSSL) and has a much lower computational complexity under the premise that the two methods have similar coherent integration performance.

abstract={Schizophrenia patients exhibit a decreased ability to detect change in their auditory environment as measured by auditory event-related potentials (ERP) such as mismatch negativity. This deficit has been linked to abnormal NMDA neurotransmission since, among other observations, non-selective channel blockers of NMDA reliably diminish automatic deviance detection in human subjects as well as in animal models. Recent molecular and functional evidence links NR2B receptor subtype to aberrant NMDA transmission in schizophrenia. However, it is unknown if NR2B receptors participate in pre-attentive deviance detection. We recorded ERP from the vertex of freely behaving rats in response to frequency mismatch protocols. We saw a robust increase in N1 response to deviants compared to standard as well as control stimuli indicating true deviance detection. Moreover, the increased negativity was highly sensitive to deviant probability. Next, we tested the effect of a non-selective NMDA channel blocker (ketamine, 30 mg/kg) and a highly selective NR2B antagonist, CP-101,606 (10 or 30 mg/kg) on deviance detection. Ketamine attenuated deviance mainly by increasing the amplitude of the standard ERP. Amplitude and/or latency of several ERP components were also markedly affected. In contrast, CP-101,606 robustly and dose-dependently inhibited the deviant's N1 amplitude, and as a consequence, completely abolished deviance detection. No other ERPs or components were affected. Thus, we report first evidence that NR2B receptors robustly participate in processes of automatic deviance detection in a rodent model. Lastly, our model demonstrates a path forward to test specific pharmacological hypotheses using translational endpoints relevant to aberrant sensory processing in schizophrenia. © 2014 Sivarao, Chen, Yang, Li, Pieschl and Ahlijanian.},

Colony color and bac-terial growth quantification were compared 18 and 48 hours after incubation. Bacteria were identified with mass spectrometry. A complementary analysis on 80 bacterial strains known to pose potential identification problems was performed. 43 urines samples grew E. coli, and 42 of them were pink-colored on the two chromogenic mediums, as expected (sensibility=97.7%). Growth quantification was significantly greater on blood agar than on chromogenic media (p&lt;0.001).We noted specificity issues at the complementary analysis with the UriSelect4® medium: Citrobacter freundii and some strains of Citrobacter brakii, Enterobacter cloacae and Hafnia alvei were pink-colored, and could be misidentified as E. coli. ChromID CPS® medium did not show such misidentification. In conclusion, the agar ChromID CPS® proved to be greater than the UriSelect4® agar in our work in terms of specificity of direct identification of E. Coli, without the use of additional test.},

abstract={13C, 15N CP/MAS, including 1H- 13C and 1H-15N short contact time CP/MAS experiments, and FTIR methods were applied for detailed structural characterization of ansa-macrolides as 3-formylrifamycin SV (1) and its derivatives (2-6) in crystal and in powder forms. Although HPLC chromatograms for 2/CH3OH and 2/CH 3CCl3 were the same for rifampicin crystals dissolved in respective solvents, the UV-vis data recorded for them were different in 300-375nm region. Detailed solid state 13C and 15N CP/MAS NMR and FTIR studies revealed that rifampicin (2), in contrast to 3-formylrifamycin SV (1) and its amino derivatives (3-6), can occur in pure non-ionic or zwitterionic forms in crystal and in pure these forms or a mixture of them in a powder. Multinuclear CP/MAS and FTIR studies demonstrated also that 3-6 derivatives were present exclusively in pure zwitterionic forms, both in powder and in crystal. On the basis of the solid state NMR and FTIR studies, two conformers of 3-formylrifamycin SV were detected in powder form due to the different orientations of carbonyl group of amide moiety. The PM6 molecular modeling at the semi-empirical level of theory, allowed visualization the most energetically favorable non-ionic and zwitterionic forms of 1-6 antibiotics, strongly stabilized via intramolecular H-bonds. FTIR studies indicated that the originally adopted forms of these type antibiotics in crystal or in powder are stable in standard laboratory conditions in time. The results presented point to the fact that because of a possible presence of two forms of rifampicin (compound 2), quantification of the content of this antibiotic in relevant pharmaceuticals needs caution. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

For the relationship between these events and raw data, a Finite State Machine (FSM) based modeling is applied. Including the raw data, these are taken as input and output to the three levels of FSMs. By using this way of event composition, not only single safety problem, but also safety level of the whole house can be precisely described. In order to verify the mechanism of hierarchical FSMs and by using this mechanism, safety problems and safety level of a house can be correctly represented. And also verify that different levels of events can precisely representing what is happening. Two simulation cases are proposed: one is heat stroke and another is carbon monoxide poisoning. The simulation result shows that the simulation targets are satisfied. © 2013 IEEE.},

Using NLMS-TEQ reduces size of the CP, and consequently leading to system performance improvement. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={As GPS was constrained for moving vehicle in urban road, a tightly coupled positioning method based on cooperative positioning (CP) and height constrained model was presented. Vehicle status informations were shared by vehicle and infrastructure based on dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) at the intersection, and an intersection collision detection method was proposed based on the cooperative communication of vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I). The simulation environments based on scenario were constructed to validate the performance of GPS/CP and intersection collision detection method, and integrated positioning simulation and multi-scenario intersection collision detection were carried out. Simulation result indicates that the positioning error of vehicle is less than 3 m when visible satellite number reduces. The number of collision vehicles and vehicle collision rates decrease, traffic volume slightly declines when vehicle number is 20 and also no positioning error exists at the intersection. Vehicle positioning error must be less than 6 m to achieve collision detection. Based on comprehensive utilization of higher positioning accuracy using GPS/CP and a safer collision detection method based on V2V/V2I, low vehicle collision rates and high traffic capacity at the intersection can be got.},

abstract={This paper presents an innovative approach to detect computational fault using design for testability (DFT) of CP-PLL (charge pump phase locked loop) to allow simple digital testing. The proposed structure is useful in mixed signal IC (incorporating both analog and digital block on the same chip) testing. With increasing complexity of mixed signal IC the demand of preparing the low cost testing circuitry also gets increased. Here CP-PLL is taken as the mixed signal IC wherein the proposed method uses the charge pump as stimulus generator and the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) as measuring device for testing the CP-PLL. It avoids the need of interfacing any foreign component and decreases the area overhead of whole IC. Moreover, testing circuitry is applied at the digital part of the CP-PLL i.e. PFD (phase frequency detector) and the analog part i.e. charge pump; loop filter and VCO are controlled by PFD only. Consequently the efficiency of the testing process avoiding the loading effect at analog node is increased. Fault simulation results indicate that the proposed structure posses high fault coverage of 98.2% and less area overhead of about 3.025%. © 2012 IEEE.},

Instead of blind detection toward even-numbered signals and odd-numbered signals of SSS, the even-numbered signals are utilized to correlation detection first; then the odd-numbered signals are used to further verify the results detected by even-numbered signals. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the computational complexity without the diction performance degradation and is very suitable for application.},

abstract={Tannin extracts were prepared from barks of maritime pine (Pinus maritimus), aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and from a mixture of barks of different pine species (Pinus spp., namely 20% black pine (Pinus thunbergii)+ 30% Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) + 20% maritime pine (Pinus maritimus) + 10% Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) + 5% Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) + 15% Norway spruce (Picea abies)) at a paper mill. The 13C-NMR spectra were carried out from these tannins. Blending systems adhesives were prepared with 5% paraformaldehyde to measure the reactivity by gel time, and to determinate the mechanical resistance by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and the internal bond strength (IB) according to the European Norm EN-312. The CP MAS 13C NMR bands at 163 ppm and the increase number of smaller bands between 20 and 65 ppm clearly indicate that the extraction of procyanidin-type tannins has been incorrect yielded high relative proportions of catechinic acid structures and diarylpropanol-catechinin acid dimer caused by internal flavonoid rearrangement, and causing the blockage of the C6 and C8 reactive sites, rendering unusable the tannin for wood adhesive applications. Thus, the gel times are very long except for the maritime pine tannin with a value of 51 (s). The TMA analysis gave very low MOE values for almost all the tannin extract samples, except for maritime pine. This situation was confirmed by the IB test. Only maritime pine tannin presented a good mechanical resistance with a value of 0.6 (MPa). Only this sample fulfils the standard requested.},

abstract={Convolutional spreading CDMA with cyclic prefix (CS-CDMA/CP) enables multiuser interference-free (MUI-free) transmission over multipath downlink channels with the use of zero correlation zone (ZCZ) codes. However, MUI-free transmission is guaranteed only when the data length D, channel delay L, and ZCZ length Z satisfy Z+1 ≥ D+L. In this paper, we consider the situation that MUI-free transmission is not realized inevitably because of excessive multipath delays or deliberately because of the necessity to get a higher bandwidth efficiency, clarify the structure of MUI in the CS-CDMA/CP system employing M-ZCZ codes, and propose iterative partial multiuser detection (IPMUD). The detection is implemented at symbol-level (after despreading) and the number of users jointly considered can be adjusted flexibly to offer a tradeoff between system performance and receiver complexity. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified numerically by density evolution approach and BER simulations. The CS-CDMA/CP system with IPMUD is shown to be much less complex than the DS-CDMA system with Wang and Poor's turbo MUD receiver and to be less complex and better, in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance, than the DS-CDMA system with iterative chip-wise equalization receivers. © 2010 IEEE.},

We show that the CS-CDMA/CP system in conjunction with a single pilot, with zero-correlation-zone code from an M-sequence (M-ZCZ), and with iterative detection works also well for fast fading, and the impacts of Doppler spreads can be made negligible without bandwidth efficiency loss by the employment of excess channel spread configuration and iterative partial multiuser detection. We compare the proposed system and the standard W-CDMA system for downlink transmission by simulation and show that both systems enjoy time-diversity effects of fast fading and that, although the W-CDMA system performs better for a small number of users, the CS-CDMA/CP system performs much better for the number of users from moderate to as large as processing gain. ©2009 IEEE.},

Because the detector is implemented in the symbol-level (after despreading) and only a partion of users are jointly considered, its receiver complexity is expected to be acceptable for a mobile terminal.

It was also shown that SIMO is superior to MISO in terms of diversity exploitation and achieves the best tradeoff between complexity and performance. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The failure of non-leaf nodes in Application Layer Multicast (ALM) tree partitions the multicast tree, which may significantly degrade the quality of multicast service. Accurate and timely failure recovery from node failures in ALM tree, which is based on the premise of efficient failure detection scheme, is critical to minimize the disruption of service. In fact, failure detection has hardly been studied in the context of ALM. Firstly, this paper analyzes the failure detection issues in ALM and then proposes a model which is based on the relationship between parent and child nodes for it. Secondly, the Cooperative-Probe based failure detection Scheme (CPS), in which the information about probe loss is shared among monitor nodes, is designed. Thirdly, the performance of CPS is analyzed. The Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can simultaneously reduce the detection time and the probability of false positive at the cost of little increased control overhead by comparing with the Basic-Probe based failure detection Scheme (BPS). Finally, some possible directions for the future work are discussed. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel common primer multiplex PCR (CP-M-PCR) was applied to detect four kinds of meats (chicken, cattle, pig and horse) as raw materials. A common adapter was designed in the 5′-end of species-specific reverse primers which matched with the species-specific DNA sequences for each species and also used as the common primer (CP). CP-M-PCR primers were designed to uncover different length fragments of 239, 292, 412, and 451 bp from chicken, cattle, pig and horse meats, respectively. The bands of specific DNA fragments amplified by CP-M-PCR method still appeared until the concentration of species-specific primers diluted to 0.015 pmol and primer sensitivity was increased by 100 times compared with conventional multiplex PCR without CP. CP-M-PCR detection limit of the DNA samples was 0.1 ng (36.4 copies) for single kind of meat as well as four kinds of meats. CP-M-PCR method simplified the PCR reaction system and conquered the disparate amplified efficiency from different primers. The CP-M-PCR method could be widely applied in practical detection for simultaneous identification of other meat species and their products. © 2008.},

abstract={A transmit signal frame structure for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink without cyclic prefix (CP) was proposed. In order to combat the inter-block interference (IBI) of OFDM symbol by reason of without CP, this paper presented a new signal detection scheme for OFDMA uplink without CP, which is based on time oversampling. The proposed signal detection scheme adopts ordered successive detection based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion to treat with the part of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol without IBI. A maximum-likelihood timing synchronization and carrier frequency offset estimation algorithm was proposed to obtain timing synchronization and the carrier frequency offset parameter. The time domain channel estimation algorithm in this paper is based on correlation of PN sequence. The simulation results demonstrate the carrier frequency offset and channel estimation algorithm can get more accurate parameters estimation, meanwhile it is immune to the noise and adapts to the fading channel, the MMSE signal detection algorithm can provide better bit error rate performance.},

abstract={Phantom model of the breast which has actual shape and size has been developed for evaluation of microwave imaging by Chirp Pulse Microwave Computed Tomography (CP-MCT). This phantom model will also be successfully used for hyperthermia experiments using microwaves. This phantom model is consisted of four kinds of tissue mimicking materials, that is, the skin-, breast fat-, muscle-, and tumor-simulators. The principal ingredients of the phantom are water, liquid paraffin, super stuff (TX-150), sugar, and salt. It is easy to simulate permittivity of the real breasts in addition to the shape and size. This is the advantage of this non-homogeneous phantom. CP-MCT is a modality for microwave imaging of a human body using chirp pulse microwaves to extract the component which transmits the straight path between two antennas.

Warming a solution of 6 above 0 °C brings about predominant generation of 32e- IrII-Ir II species [(Cp*Ir)(μ-dmpm)(μ-H)(IrCp*)][OTf] (7).

Intermolecular C-H bond activation reactions with 7 are also examined. Reactions of 7 with aromatic molecules (benzene, toluene, furan, and pyridine) at room temperature result in the smooth sp2 C-H activation to give [(Cp*Ir)(H)(μ-dmpm)(μ-H)(Ar)(IrCp*)][OTf] (Ar = Ph (9); Ar = m-Tol (10a) or p-Tol (10b); Ar = 2-Fur (11)) and [(Cp*Ir)(H) (μ-dmpm)(μ-C5H4N)(H)(IrCp*)][OTf] (12), respectively.

The reaction involves as an intermediate the unprecedented alkyl η1-alkene complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(η1-CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+, in which C(2) is essentially carbocationic and the C(1)-C(2) bond order is sufficiently low that rotation about it occurs. The hydrogen atoms of the methyl group on C(2) are sufficiently acidic that proton transfer to the Zr-Me group occurs to generate the allylic product. It seems likely that the chemistry described here provides a rationale for deactivation of propene polymerization catalysts since the normal products of chain transfer, polymers with vinylidene end groups, should form allylic species in the same way.

The interchannel interference (ICI) and the residual intersymbol interference (ISI) could be introduced by time varying channel with channel impulse response that exceeds the length of CP. The influence mentioned above would result in error floor. The method proposed, combined with ICI cancellation, uses decisions to estimate the residual ISI through fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), and restores the cyclicity of signals. It also can be applied with this algorithm for non-sample spaced channel with a very low computational complexity. Simulations show that the algorithm presented could provide better performance on static and slowly time-varying ISI channels.},

abstract={A fast and accurate method to quantify the new immunosuppressive JAK3 inhibitor CP-690,550 in whole blood using a dual-pump liquid chromatography-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS) system was developed and validated in nonhuman primate blood. Before injection, blood samples were prepared by precipitation with a reagent that included methanol and acetonitrile (30:70, vol/vol) along with the internal standard (CP-istd). Column-switching LC/LC-MS analysis used online extraction followed by separation on a C8 analytic column and MS detection of the [M + H]+ CP-690,550 (m/z = 313.1) and CP internal standard (m/z = 288.1). Linearity was always better than r2 = 0.99 (n = 7) for CP-690,550 (range 2.5-750 ng/mL), with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 2.5 ng/mL. The intrarun accuracy and precision ranged from 103.0% to 105.4% and 2.7% to 4.3%, respectively (n = 5), and the interday precision ranged from 8.7% to 11.1%, and the interday accuracy ranged from 98.1% to 103.8% of nominal values (n = 14). The injection repeatability for the method was 1.3% (n = 7). Except for the LLOQ, the intraday accuracy and precision in human blood were also within 15% (n = 5). The combination of simple sample preparation and short analytic run time of this sensitive procedure makes it effective for monitoring the concentration of CP-690,550 in whole blood in organ-transplant recipients.

abstract={The geomembrane which is laid vertically underground has been widely used in water conservancy, building groundwork and environment engineering, etc., to prevent seepage flow in the past 20 years in China. During being laid underground, the geomembrane may not extend to the designable depth and be lacerated by sharp stone, maybe there are some blanks between the border upon plastics series. All those can make the seepage flow through the geomembrane. So it is important to inspect the conformation of those impervious geomembrane after they have been laid vertically underground. But 2D flimsy body laid vertically underground like this geomembrane is difficult to be inspected with the usual detection method. In order to meet this require, the two-row current and potential (CP) electrode array is designed to detect it on the base of electrostatic field theory. By theoretical analysis and field studies, the abnormal resistivity pattern of different conformation, the inspection precision of this method and the results different settings lead to have been made certain. The theoretical analysis and field study show the lower resistivity patterns in apparent resistivity section can reflects that the conformation of geomembrane and their size are corresponding; the blanks between the border upon plastics series can make the lower resistivity pattern larger; one tenth change of the depth of geomembrane and 0.1 m width of blank between the border upon plastics series could be detected with this method. The research result can make sure that the conformation of impervious geomembrane which is laid vertically underground can be detected clearly with the two-row CP electrode array.},

abstract={Charge-Pump Phase-locked loops are currently used in a variety of SoC signal generation applications. They ultimately determine performance of other SoC blocks, such as ADC's, DAC's, RF and synchronisation functions. In many situations, only simple frequency lock tests are carried out on the CP-PLL portion of a circuit, with other complex direct jitter tests being carried out indirectly at a higher system level. Although these higher level system tests must generally be carried out at some point they can be time consuming. In addition, if the PLL is designed and operating correctly the PLL system will generally have far better performance than the system it is driving. This paper investigates typical jitter output responses of CP-PLLs when subjected to selected forward path leakage faults. The evaluation platform consists of a macro level mixed signal based PLL-Model. Degradation of the PLL output is evaluated from the phase noise spectrum, jitter spectrum and sideband spur degradation. Further evaluations and analysis are supplied relating block level effects to jitter and phase noise. Investigations are made as to the efficacy of detection of these errors with simple measurement techniques. The crux of the work is thus initially to develop techniques to aid evaluation of the likely jitter performance of a CP-PLL system without resorting to direct measurement techniques. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

Two biopsies were for histology (gold standard), one for CPtest, scored at 20min, Ih and 24h for the presence of urease activity. Gastric biopsy was then removed from CPtest and used for ureC-targeted PCR. Fifty-five (68.7%) patients were positive for H. pylori infection by histology. CPtest yielded an overall diagnostic accuracy of 93.8% (95% CI: 91-96.4%), regardless of observation period. No erroneous categorization of H. pylori status occurred using PCR, yielding sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall diagnostic accuracy of 100%. Our results suggest that H. pylori can be detected by PCR in gastric biopsies previously taken for CPtest, so reducing the workload of the endoscopist by saving additional biopsies for culture analysis and susceptibility tests.},

abstract={The energy detection of continuous phase frequency shift keying (CP-FSK) signals is the optimum noncoherent detection technique yielding a minimum bit error rate (BER) on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. This scheme is usually used when carrier phase estimation is difficult. When a CP-FSK signal is passed through a frequency selective multipath fading channel, inter-symbol interference (ISI) is introduced which distorts the received signal waveform. However, this ISI can be compensated and the BER improved by use of sequence estimation at the output of the energy detectors. In this paper, we derive an analytical upper bound as well as a lower bound on the BER for this scheme on the multipath fading channels and compare the results with the computer simulation to show the effectiveness of the technique. © 1999 IEEE.},

abstract={Different activation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) promoters results in distinct expression patterns of EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and may further decide the role of EBV in the cellular pathogenesis. In EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies, it has generally been believed that Q promoter (Qp)-initiated EBNA1 is the only EBNA gene to be expressed and that the other two viral promoters, Cp and Wp, which can lead to expression of EBNA1-6, are inactive. However, the failure to demonstrate the activities of Cp and Wp may have been due to the limited sensitivities of detection approaches used. In the present article, the EBV promoter usage and gene expression were re-examined in both EBV-infected NPC cells in vitro and NPC biopsies in vivo. An NPC cell line susceptible to EBV infection in vitro was established by transfection with a plasmid expressing a well-known EBV receptor, CR2. The presence of viral DNA and EBNA proteins was demonstrated in these EBV-infected cells using PCR and anticomplement immunofluorescence assay, respectively. As has been identified in NPC biopsias, viral transcripts of Qp-initiated EBNA1, latent membrane protein (LMP)I, LMP2A, LMP2B, and BarmHI A genes, as well as the EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)1 were detected in these in vitro-infected cells using reverse-transcription-PCR. Notably, viral transcripts initiated from Cp or Wp were also found in the infected cells. Furthermore, Cp- or Wp-initiated transcripts and EBNA2. mRNA were detected in some NPC biopsies. Taking advantage of this sensitive detection approach, our observation that Cp and Wp may be active in NPC cells raises the possibility that EBNA2 to 6, in addition to EBNA1, may play roles in the pathogenesis of NPC.},

abstract={Abstract: In the comparison of bacteriological and histological methods, the rapid urease (RU) test was considered a specific (100%) method for detection of Campylobacter Pylori (Cp), by which the presence of Cp can be rapidly judged (more than 90% in 20 min.). For an accurate and reliable diagnosis, other methods should be used concurrently, because the sensitivity of this test was inferior to bacteriological methods by 10 to 20%. In the histological study, polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration in the antral mucosa clearly reflected Cp infection. This pathological change responded well to antibacterial therapy. Of some endoscopic findings in the gastric antrum, verrucous change was considered to have a relatively close association with Cp infection. However, about 30% of Cp‐present cases had endoscopically no abnormal appearance in the gastric antrum. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Chemically peculiar (CP) stars are mainly found among B and A stars. Present theories are not able to account fully for the observed spectrum anomalies, suggesting that in the atmospheres of stars in the range of Te, where mass loss is no longer very large and convection is still not very important, the present theoretical approach needs further refinement. Moreover, the lack of laboratory data is responsible, at least partly, for the discrepancies between observed and computed stellar energy distributions. The choice for quick detection of CP stars among faint objects is reviewed; the measure of the flux depression at λ5200 appears to be very powerful, and the identification of this complex feature is urgently needed. The need to separate the various subclasses of the He abnormal stars in a standard way is underlined and further analyses of the characteristics of the λ Boo stars are required. The problem of the determination of Te and consequently of realistic atmospheric abundance anomalies of CP stars is discussed. © 1987 D. Reidel Publishing Company.},

This arrangement makes possible α-, β- and γ-detection, and gives a limited ability to discriminate between these three types of radiation. The detection sensitivities usually found when using the Juno are: α, ~ 300 dis/min; β, 1-2 mrad/hr; and γ, 1-2 mR/hr. The Bumble Bee has several advantages over the Juno. It is a four-decade instrument with 10 times the Juno's electronic sensitivity; typical Bumble Bee sensitivities are: α, 200 dis/min; β, ~ 0.2 mrad/hr; and γ, ~ 0.2 mR/hr.
