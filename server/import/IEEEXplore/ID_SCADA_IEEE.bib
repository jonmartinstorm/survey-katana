abstract={Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including electric power, oil & gas and others. The protocols used in this domain were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks, leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple language grammar allows network engineers to describe system characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS. An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring needs.},

abstract={Increased interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in renewable power system networks can potentially mean greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems have inherent cyber vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with limited consideration of cyber attacks or threats. There is little published literature which rigorously considers SCADA-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the IEC 608705-104 protocol. This paper presents a rule-based IDS for IEC 60870-5-104 driven SCADA networks using an in-depth protocol analysis and a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method.

abstract={World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed “What-if” module.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in real-time systems is a problem without a profound solution. In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of OCSVM models. These trained models run in parallel and can accurately and fast recognise different types of attacks.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.},

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism.},

abstract={Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems. Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks. A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI) etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3. The proposed testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)networks are widely deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs)such as energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution, and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.},

This article aims to contribute to assess the state-of-the-art, identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas. To achieve these objectives, we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS solutions.

abstract={Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with and without the TFIDS.},

abstract={In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Malicious data in a SCADA system disrupt its correct functioning and tamper with its normal operation. OCSVM (One-Class Support Vector Machine) is an intrusion detection mechanism that does not need any labeled data for training or any information about the kind of anomaly is expecting for the detection process. This feature makes it ideal for processing SCADA environment data and automate SCADA performance monitoring. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project and communicates with the other parts of the system by the exchange of IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) messages that carry information about the source of the incident, the time and a classification of the alarm.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%.},

abstract={The increased complexity and interconnectivity of SCADA infrastructure in the power system have exposed it to the multitude of vulnerabilities. There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later, compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.},

These systems are increasingly the target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS, Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its performance in low performance hardware systems.},

The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks.

abstract={The massive use of information and communication technologies in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of lp-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks.},

abstract={SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units; however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control devices. A support vector of type “Class One” machine and a test lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.},
