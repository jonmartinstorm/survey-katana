abstract={Current intrusion detection system (IDS) technology is not suited to be widely deployed inside a supervisory, control and data acquisition (SCADA) environment. Anomaly- and signature-based IDS technologies have developed methods to cover information technology-based networks activity and protocols effectively. However, these IDS technologies do not include the fine protocol granularity required to ensure network security inside an environment with weak protocols lacking authentication and encryption. By implementing a more specific and more intelligent packet inspection mechanism, tailored traffic flow analysis, and unique packet tampering detection, IDS technology developed specifically for SCADA environments can be deployed with confidence in detecting malicious activity.},

abstract={The present paper describes some issues in working with large data files downloaded from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (S.C.A.D.A) systems. The data files management was possible by implementing two high level software applications. The first high level application converts and extracts relevant data from different types of very large S.C.A.D.A downloaded files - Microsoft Excel files format into Microsoft Access Databases (MBD), containing hundreds of million of records. The second high level application displays a two dimensional graph for sensor values on a specified period of time. In this way we can observe the sensor evolution and closely monitoring some possible “mission - critical” situations which can badly disturb the functionality of the entire system.},

abstract={Cyber physical systems (CPS) are process control systems interacting with the cyber world. Once connected to the internet, they become prone to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved. Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model. Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base will be first trained using simulated data of the system including faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained, real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge base using comparator to detect anomalies. On detection of abnormal data, they will then be further identified as faults or attacks.},

abstract={In recent years, the number of information security incidents of industry controlling system has increased dramatically. The intrusion detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive attention. As one of powerful and light weight Network Intrusion Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP is very important for the industry controlling systems which use Profinet to connect.

So the intrusion detection of ICS has a great significance. This paper based on the intrusion detection by telemetry analysis, optimized the system model, captured the communication packets between different nodes in the system, then extracted features for machine learning to achieve malicious traffic detection, and the attack types are further distinguished. Telemetry means that it does not need to enter the industrial control system network, but by capturing data packets remotely to achieve intrusion detection.},

abstract={The technology for predicting dynamic data flows plays an important role in building systems for detecting anomalies in protecting the information of various industrial automatic control systems (IACS). In order to improve the quality of forecasting dynamic data flows, it is proposed to apply preliminary digital processing (filtering) of signals to decompose the observed time series coming from the sensors of the IACS into separate components, that is, to conduct a preliminary structural analysis of the observed time series. With this approach, component decomposition of the initial signal and serial noise filtering using a parallel set of digital filters are performed, which (as shown in the investigation) significantly improves the quality of the generated forecast. The study also conducted an analysis of the error of the forecast result, that is, the signal of the difference between the original signal and its forecast, using digital spectral and bispectral analysis. It is assumed that for the case of “perfect prediction” the prediction error is an unpredictable residue, that is, tends to a state of white noise. The paper shows that the analysis of forecast errors using digital spectral and bispectral analysis methods allows you to form an assessment of the quality of the forecast result. In the study, a comparison of the results for the case of generating a forecast using and without using preliminary digital filtering was carried out on the same initial test signal. The structure of the compared neural networks (generating the forecast) was the same and the training data sets and the target data sets for generating the forecast were identical. The comparison shows a significant increase in the efficiency of using preliminary digital filtering in order to increase the accuracy of forecasting. Work with neural networks was carried out in the MATLAB “Deep Learning Toolbox” expansion pack. For spectral and bispectral analysis, the “Higher Order Spectral Analysis Toolbox” package was used.},

abstract={In the hierarchical control paradigm of a smart grid cyber-physical system, decentralized local agents (LAs) can potentially be compromised by opportunistic attackers to manipulate electricity prices for illicit financial gains. In this paper, to address such opportunistic attacks, we propose a Dirichlet-based detection scheme, where a Dirichlet-based probabilistic model is built to assess the reputation levels of LAs. Initial reputation levels of the LAs are first trained using the proposed model, based on their historical operating observations. An adaptive detection algorithm with reputation incentive mechanism is then employed to detect opportunistic attackers. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed scheme using data collected from the IEEE 39-bus power system with the PowerWorld simulator.},

abstract={In this research, we proposed a process-based anomaly detection method for Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Our method performs relaxation on monitoring the data and focuses more on the relationship of the execution order of message passing between the devices in the MQTT-based network. First, we performed a `bird's eye' monitoring technique to discover the execution order of message passing in the MQTT network with process mining. Then, we grasp the structure of the process model with a tree model called a process tree. Using the process tree, we check the deviations of normal behavior's process tree and the monitored behavior's process tree. Since CPS is a closed-loop system and MQTT protocol has pre-specified execution, we can easily detect deviations in the process tree as an anomaly. However, it is still hard to perform forensic analysis. Next, we proposed a forensic analysis method, which comes as an advantage of this approach compared to the black-boxed detection method, such as machine learning. The process-based approach can backtrack message passing by traversing the process tree and identify the execution operator in the parent nodes to find affected devices and execution order related to the incident. Finally, we showed an application example and evaluation of our method.},

Subsequently two adaptive sliding mode observers with on line parameter estimation are designed to estimate state attacks and sensor attacks separately. Second, appropriate residual signals are constructed and it is shown that they approach to the attacks with ultimately uniformly bounded errors.

abstract={Stroke is one of the fatal diseases that affect the brain and causes death within 3 to 10 h. However, most of the deaths caused by a stroke can be avoided with the identification of the nature of stroke and react to it in a timely manner by intelligent health systems. The state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) enable interaction between physical and computational world to identify any anomaly in the physical world and respond to it. The response of CPS may vary depending upon the context of the physical world. Extensive research has been done in this area from the perspective of wireless sensor networks, body area networks, and wearable smart devices. This paper proposes a CPS for detecting the occurrence of stroke in patients, who have a high risk of stroke or have survived a stroke before. The developed CPS sends recorded data to the doctor and alerts him when the stroke occurs. The proposed system is operating on data acquired from electroencephalography sensors from patients' brain. This article aimed at decreasing human mortality rate due to stroke and will bridge the gaps in CPS due to interdisciplinary isolation. The disciplines involved in the development of a CPS include communication networks, pattern recognition, software engineering, mathematics, and biomedical.},

abstract={With the advent of 5G, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) employed in the vertical industries and critical infrastructures will depend on the cellular network more than ever; making their attack surface wider. Hence, guarding the network against cyber-attacks is critical not only for its primary subscribers but to prevent it from being exploited as a proxy to attack CPSs. In this study, we propose a consolidated framework, by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and real network data, to provide early-detection for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks orchestrated by a botnet that controls malicious devices.

abstract={The introduction of the cyber-physical system (CPS) into power systems has created a variety of communication requirements and functions that existing legacy systems do not support. To this end, the IEEE 1815.1 standard defines the mapping between existing distributed network protocol networks and IEC 61850 networks that reflect new requirements. However, advanced CPS cyberattacks have been reported, and in order to address cyberattacks, security research on new power systems that use network devices and heterogeneous communication is necessary. In this study, we propose an intrusion detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based power system using CPS. We 1) analyze an IEEE 1815.1-based power system network and propose a suitable application method for an intrusion detection system, 2) suggest a bidirectional recurrent neural network-based anomaly detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based network, and 3) demonstrate the verification of the proposed technique using various power system-specific attack data, including real power system using CPS network traffic, CPS malware behavior (CMB), false data injection (FDI), and disabling reassembly (DR) attacks. Proposed technique successfully detected five types of CMB attacks, three types of FDI and DR attacks.},

abstract={The main aim of this paper is to provide intensive solution for heart attack through Cyber Physical System (CPS). Cyber Physical System is one of the blooming technologies with wide range of applications. Currently the interest towards design and implementation of CPS is highly increasing. It is expected that CPS will play a vital role in the progress of upcoming embedded systems. In this paper we have proposed a system to provide efficient and quick solution to heart attack patients who are at great risk. Advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has created an enormous impact on the current medical health care scenario. It has enabled the design of small sized wireless communication systems at low cost. A small wearable wireless monitoring system inspects the patient's ECG signals continuously and transmits the signals to decision making and control systems. The control system is capable of controlling the actuation system which is fitted to the body of the patients. The warning system sends an alert in case of emergency to the caretakers mobile. Our proposed system uses low cost, energy efficient and reliable zigbee technology for communication among the physical components and hence the effectiveness of the system is improved. This life saving system reduces the mortality rate of heart patients and it act as an effective heart care service to patients.},

pages={2126-2137},
abstract={Bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, and fingerprint, are ideal for establishing authentication in the futuristic networks, such as the medical cyber physical systems (MCPSs). In such a network, to authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the network as cloud computation and communication is removed. Our proposal is verified on real datasets of the face, iris, and fingerprint bio-modalities provided by the Warsaw, Replay-Attack, and LiveDet 2015 Crossmatch benchmark, respectively. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art architectures in four out of six tests. Besides, we show that the FA-RF can significantly reduce the training and testing time in both the cloud and the on-device AI node.},

abstract={Bio-modalities are ideal for user authentication in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems. Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained, heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors. Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis. Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS. In this regard, we propose a machine learning based security algorithm run as an application at the fog node using a binarized multi-factor boosted ensemble learner algorithm coupled with feature selection. Our proposal is verified on real datasets provided by the Replay Attack, Warsaw and LiveDet 2015 Crossmatch benchmark for face, iris and fingerprint modality spoofing detection used for authentication in an MCPS. The experimental analysis shows that our approach achieves significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract={The emerging smart grid, cyber-physical infrastructure, provides a steady, secure, and reliable power system over the current power grid. Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120 samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm has been tested in real-time using an OPAL-RT digital real-time simulator.},

From the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) point of view, S-VFDCPS consists of enterprise level, gateway level and endpoint level, with relevant vibration detection services on each level. From the Cyber-Physical system (CPS) point of view, it contains three layers: the monitoring and control layer, the network layer and the device layer.

pages={3311-3321},
abstract={In this article, an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) is utilized for monitoring critical events such as structural equipment conditions in industrial environments. Such a system can easily be a point of attraction for the cyberattackers, in addition to system faults, severe resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy), and environmental problems. This makes data collection in the ICPS untrustworthy, even the data are altered after the data forwarding. Without validating this before data aggregation, detection of an event through the aggregation in the ICPS can be difficult. This article introduces TrustData, a scheme for high-quality data collection for event detection in the ICPS, referred to as “Trust worthy and secured Data collection” scheme. It alleviates authentic data for accumulation at groups of sensor devices in the ICPS. Based on the application requirements, a reduced quantity of data is delivered to an upstream node, say, a cluster head. We consider that these data might have sensitive information, which is vulnerable to being altered before/after transmission. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, we provide the concept of TrustData to verify whether or not the acquired data are trustworthy (unaltered) before transmission, and whether or not the transmitted data are secured (data privacy is preserved) before aggregation. Second, we utilize a general measurement model that helps to verify acquired signal untrustworthy before transmitting toward upstream nodes. Finally, we provide an extensive performance analysis through a real-world dataset, and our results prove the effectiveness of TrustData.},

Protecting data from unwanted access by modifying it through cryptography, hiding data or digitally signing it are some of the solutions available. Just as important however is to detect and prevent attacks. We propose a system with hierarchical access to data which is gained through a digital signature algorithm. We focus our attention on detecting and preventing attacks through a less conventional method - complex event processing. Any action within the cyber-physical system can be viewed as an event, such as digitally signing a message. With this idea in mind we propose a solution that allows designing a secure cyber-physical system with an efficient attack detection architecture.},

abstract={Paroxysmal diseases of inpatients are globally recognized as one of the top challenges in medicine. Poor clinical outcomes are primarily caused by delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnostic criteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and already overloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuring devices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physical characterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains to provide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnoses of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medical knowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model to characterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiency between physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-based medical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integrate medical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decision support. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstrate that we enable early detection in 11.02% more patients and detect the condition 16.57 hours earlier on average.},

abstract={In the engineering of cyber-physical systems the engineering process typically focuses on single systems and not on the entire system network. Within the system network the different specification artifacts (in consequence also the implemented systems) for the various cyber-physical systems evolve independently even though they highly interact with each other. As a result, inconsistencies between the different specification artifacts can emerge. An inconsistency implies that at least one artifact is incorrect. Following, specification inconsistencies among single cyber-physical systems within an entire system network endanger correct functioning of the network. Hence, it is of importance to identify all existing inconsistencies and to correct the corresponding artifacts. Therefore, this paper suggests a solution concept for supporting the identification and repair of inconsistencies in interaction-based specification artifacts. The approach relies (i) on the automated detection of inconsistencies among overlapping specification artifacts of different systems participating in the same cyber-physical network, and (ii) on the automated proposal of valid solution options to aid the engineers in decision making w.r.t. resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we apply the solution idea to ITU message sequence charts as a typical notation format for interaction-based behavioral specification artifacts of cyber-physical systems.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel improved coherently integrated cubic phase function (ICI-CPF) algorithm is proposed for the cubic phase signal (CPS). The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. Firstly, transform the CPS to the lag-frequency domain, in which auto-terms are concentrated into straight lines passing through the origin of the two-dimensional plane. Based on this important property, the auto-terms are coherently accumulated along the straight lines. Finally, search the distinct peaks in the chirp rate (CR)-quadratic chirp rate (QCR) domain, and estimate the CR and QCR, simultaneously. ICICPF algorithm can be proved to be with well auto-term accumulation and cross-term suppression capabilities by theory analysis and simulations. Besides, compared with several existing algorithms, it shows superior anti-noise performance and acceptable computation complexity. Based on ICICPF algorithm, a novel multi-component CPS detection method is presented, which is able to eliminate the shadow effect among the components and realize the components detection. Simulations and real measured data processing results proves its validity.},

abstract={The integration of communication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) increases their vulnerability towards cyber-attacks, causing devastating outcomes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are mainly developed to support information technology systems, count vastly on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber-attacks. Besides, most IDSs do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thereby suffering from low accuracy and high false-positive when being put to use. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to construct new balanced representations of the imbalanced datasets. The new representations are fed into an ensemble deep learning attack detection model specifically designed for an ICS environment. The proposed attack detection model leverages Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to detect cyber-attacks from the new representations. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on 10-fold cross-validation on two real ICS datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), DNN, and AdaBoost, as well as recent existing models in the literature. The proposed approach is a generalized technique, which can be implemented in existing ICS infrastructures with minimum effort.},

The method uses RIPCA algorithm to remove outliers in industrial data sets and realize dimensionality reduction. In combination with the advantages of OCSVM on the single classification problem, an anomaly detection model is established, and the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) is used for model parameter optimization.

Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of.

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) used in industrial plants are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can cause fatal damage to the plants. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor ICS network traffic and detect suspicious activities. However, many IDSs overlook sophisticated cyber-attacks because it is hard to make a complete database of cyber-attacks and distinguish operational anomalies when compared to an established baseline. In this paper, a discriminant model between normal and anomalous packets was constructed with a support vector machine (SVM) based on an ICS communication profile, which represents only packet intervals and length, and an IDS with the applied model is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed IDS was evaluated using penetration tests on our cyber security test bed. Although the IDS was constructed by the limited features (intervals and length) of packets, the IDS successfully detected cyber-attacks by monitoring the rate of predicted attacking packets.},

abstract={Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used “air-gap” security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect. Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted through the network but is not inherently the data used by the transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker and engineer on the Internet.},

abstract={Modbus over TCP/IP is one of the most popular industrial network protocol that are widely used in critical infrastructures. However, vulnerability of Modbus TCP protocol has attracted widely concern in the public. The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic. SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false negative.},

abstract={Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage Ethernet to allow interoperability between solutions from different vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect, created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets. This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyberdefensive architecture by using a Raspberry Pi based ModbusTCP control system that enables simulation of cyber-attacks, and illustrates a mitigation measure with the added feature of Modbus monitoring using Snort.},

abstract={Detecting process-based attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) is challenging. These cyber-attacks are designed to disrupt the industrial process by changing the state of a system, while keeping the system's behaviour close to the expected behaviour. Such anomalous behaviour can be effectively detected by an event-driven approach. Petri Net (PN) model identification has proved to be an effective method for event-driven system analysis and anomaly detection. However, PN identification-based anomaly detection methods require ICS device logs to be converted into event logs (sequence of events). Therefore, in this paper we present a formalised method for pre-processing and transforming ICS device logs into event logs. The proposed approach outperforms the previous methods of device logs processing in terms of anomaly detection. We have demonstrated the results using two published datasets.},

abstract={Industrial realize that SCADA System was built without considering the security aspect. It was believe that there will be no attacks go to the SCADA plant using malware, such as botnet. Botnets are now the key platform for many Internet attacks, such as spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing. Most of the current botnet detection approaches work only on specific botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as botnets change their C&C techniques. In this research, we study vertexnet malware attack on a SCADA Server so that it can identify a SCADA Operator machine. The identification was used by analyzing and comparing process list which is run on the infecting host, so the attacker didn't take the wrong target, taking over the SCADA and sending some command to disrupt or operate the plant or machine, and to identifying of Botnet Vertexnet function and activity. From the experiment conducted, we get result that botnet Vertexnet can identifying SCADA Operator, taking over the server, and the activity can be detected effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The device fingerprinting- based intrusion classification and detection approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.},

abstract={Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including electric power, oil & gas and others. The protocols used in this domain were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks, leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple language grammar allows network engineers to describe system characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS. An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring needs.},

abstract={GPS receiver is the source of synchronization in phasor measurement unit (PMU) networks. While it guarantees time precision, it is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may modify the time offset and results in mismatches in time. This modification (GPS spoofing attack) changes the phase angle of signals measured by PMU. This article deals with three important challenges in GPS spoofing attack detection; first, multiattack detection while there are probable attacks on different PMUs, second, attack detection considering the dynamic model of power systems, and third, measurement correction. For providing solution to the abovementioned problems, an anti-GPS spoofing attack mechanism is suggested, in which, a dynamic filter with the help of PMU and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems measurements estimate the phase shifts caused by spoofing attacks. The results of data fusion of PMUs and SCADA in the detection method are shown. Numerical results demonstrate that this approach can detect dynamic spoofing attacks in a reasonable time and as soon as multiple attacks are detected, corrected measurements are provided.},

As a result, we have an opportunity to increase our effectiveness. However, there is a drawback. Contemporary systems becoming much more interconnected and opened. However, it negatively affects cyber security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Therefore, the reliable security system must be applied in order to increase system resilience. The article deals with widely used systems for intrusion detection (IDS).

abstract={A fiber optics based sensing network applicable for fault detection in power system is presented. The proposed scheme is secure and immune from interferences. At each monitoring location, passive rugged fiber-Bragg-grating-based sensors are deployed. They use fast and compact magnetostrictive transducers instead of current or potential transformers to translate current induced magnetic field into optical signal. These sensors can be compensated for temperature drift and easily be integrated into an optical sensing network. A broadband light source at a substation scans the change in reflected optical power at a unique frequency band that corresponds to the surge in magnetic field associated with an increased fault current at a certain location. A unique feature of this real-time scheme is that it only requires current information for fault detections in both radial and networked systems with various pole structures and line configurations. It can easily coordinate with other protective devices and is free from any time-current coordination curves. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested by simulations. They confirm that the proposed scheme is able to detect the faults irrespective of the type and location. It also performs well in presence of harmonics, high impedance, and sensors malfunctions, as well as sensor noise. PLC/SCADA technology is associated to each sensor allowing the high impedance fault occurrence information to reach the protection equipment located closer to or at the substation},

abstract={World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed “What-if” module.},

A WTFD method using only SCADA data and data mining algorithm is proposed. Firstly, select representative variables from a wide variety of SCADA variables using ARD (Automatic Relevance Determination) method. Then, the denoising autoencoders (DAE) model using the selected variables with sliding window is developed to capture nonlinear correlations among multiple variables and autocorrelation of each variable. Finally, using the Mahalanobs distance (MD) of reconstruction error to make the WTFD. Real world dataset is used to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can provide advanced failure alarm for wind turbines many hours before failure happens. The results of our proposed WTFD method can reduce operation & maintenance cost and improve wind turbine reliability.},

abstract={The integration of networks within an organization made many critical infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet. CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them, thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable configurations on critical infrastructure network devices.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in real-time systems is a problem without a profound solution. In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of OCSVM models. These trained models run in parallel and can accurately and fast recognise different types of attacks.},

abstract={Developing effective wind turbine fault detection algorithm is not only meaningful for improving wind turbine reliability but also crucial for future intelligent wind farm operation and management. Typical wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring is based on vibration signals, which is effective to detect failures with high frequency signal range. But it may not be effective on low speed components which have low frequency signal characteristic of different failure modes. SCADA system collecting multiple low frequency signals provides a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines health and performance, while its capability on fault detection is still an open issue. To systematic understand wind turbine systems, this paper presents research results of model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection. Through a detail analysis of thermodynamic process of gearbox lubrication system, a wind turbine drive train model which considers heat transferring mechanism in gearbox lubrication system is built to derive robust relationships between transmission efficiency, temperature, and rotational speed signals of wind turbine gearbox and suggest useful information for lubrication system design and optimization. The result obtained in this work is useful for wind turbine gearbox design and effective algorithm development of fault detection.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.},

abstract={Summary form only given. We present a new method for protecting chips against counterfeits that makes the IC identification more accessible to the end user. Our method requires the original chip manufacturer to frequently publish identification sequences for each IC. These sequences are excerpts from the output of a stream cipher that is embedded in the protected chip and parameterized by a secret unique key. The key initialization is done by a trusted party after manufacturing. For IC verification, the end user measures the side channel leakage of the chip under test. The chip is assessed to be genuine if the end user finds a significant correlation between the observed side channel leakage and several previously published identification sequences. We provide a proof of concept implementation on an FPGA using the hardware-tailored stream cipher Trivium. Our results show that for the cost of a small number of logic gates, we can determine in the field whether an IC is genuine by measuring the electromagnetic emanation of the chip using low-cost equipment.},

abstract={A testing structure was developed to more effectively detect the poly stringer defects in contemporary CMOS ICs. This structure is much more sensitive to poly stringer defects and is closer to the real product layout than the currently widely used structure using an active dummy underneath a poly comb. Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 μn foundries process detect were stringers to characterize the processing design with the process testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width. This structure can be used to identify new designs for manufacturing rules for the active space. Thus, this method is very useful for IC foundries to detect poly stringers and to characterize the processing line isolation and tune the process recipe to improve product yields.},

abstract={Increasing test coverage of power integrity in manufacturing test of 3D-ICs is necessary to achieve zero DPPM (Defect Parts Per Million) in the market. Although only functional tests are applied to analog circuits such as power distribution networks in general, applying structural tests will increase the coverage. This paper proposes to measure resistance between a pair of bumps under TSVs (Through Silicon Vias) to detect open defects of the TSVs as a part of structural power integrity test. Diagnostic performance of each bump pair is evaluated by simulations and the best one is selected to detect each TSV defect. Resistance threshold for the defect detection is determined considering trade-off between fault coverage and yield loss. Experimental simulations of power distribution network in a 3DIC with 2 dies are conducted and the trade-off between them is derived.},

abstract={Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about 250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by using the proposed methodology.},

abstract={Defects in through-silicon vias (TSVs) due to fabrication steps decrease the yield and reliability of 3-D stacked integrated circuits, and hence these defects need to be detected early to reduce chip's DPM. In this paper, a new fault detection and repair method for TSVs in 3D-ICs is proposed. The contribution of the method is to detect stuck-at-faults and delay-based fault in TSV by a scan-based built-in self-test (BIST) architecture. This test architecture supports both pre-bond and post-bond TSV testing. By constructing RC model and analyzing the delay characteristics of TSV, the variation of TSV-to-substrate resistance caused by TSV defects can be mapped to the change of path delay so that the related fault can be detected. Based on the test architecture, we propose a TSV redundancy structure to repair circuit after failed TSVs are detected. Results of fault detection effectiveness are presented through ModelSim simulations using realistic models under 65 nm CMOS technology. And redundancy design leads to 99.9846% recovery rate for TSVs with only 0.2% redundancy rate of TSVs.},

abstract={There have been serious concerns recently about the security of microchips from hardware trojan horse insertion during manufacturing. This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics, communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to detect trojan effects. We also provide experimental results.},

year={1998},
volume={},

pages={150-152},
abstract={Traditional testing is based on applying signals to circuit inputs and observing logic stale of outputs. However, with the introduction of CMOS technology a new test technique emerged, that is based on applying signal inputs and observing standby electrical current. This technique is known as IDDQ testing. In most CMOS circuits, when all inputs are frozen in place and circuit transient activities settle down, the current drops by 3-5 orders of magnitude below normal levels. During testing, if there is a deviation from this behavior a defect is detected. While parametric test of electric current has always been popular (including in bipolar and NMOS technologies) to detect a short between power supply lines, the promise of IDDQ test is that it will also allow detection of bridging between signal nets and transistor stuck-on faults in CMOS circuits. However, in reality, the resolution of the size of the defect is limited by the magnitude of stand-by current. Since normal process variation can cause a shift in stand-by current by two orders of magnitude, choosing a single threshold for IDDQ defect detection is impractical. Many ideas have been proposed to overcome this problem, most of which are based on choosing an adaptive cut-off point for a wafer, or a lot. In this paper, we suggest a technique, that in concept, is akin to setting an individual cutoff point for a die. The concept has been validated based on actual data.},

abstract={Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an important clinical problem of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which incurs approximately 90% of all TBI-related costs. However, current detection approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria, paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First, a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria. With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and provide timely decision supports. Evaluations on 107 clinical cases extracted from medical publications demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our integrated system.},

abstract={These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can execute illegal operations within the normal network communication defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work, we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state. We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection rules.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are more vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks than the conventional systems because of the tight integration of the cyber, communication and control aspects of CPS. Deceptive attacks are very severe on such systems because they go undetected when classical detectors like chi-squared detector is used. Once such deceptive attack that we focus in this paper are false data injection attacks, where the attacker inputs carefully designed false attack vectors. Chi-square detector which detects based on the statistics of deviations of the residual i.e. difference of observed measurement and estimated measurement fails to detect these attacks, since the statistics is not changed in these attacks. “Cosine similarity detector” was proposed to detect False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in smart grid scenario. However, we show that there exists attack vectors that remain stealthy to both chi-square as well as the cosine-square detectors. We propose an random coding scheme to modify the measurements at random, unknown to the attacker while known to the estimator. We establish that our coding scheme in conjunction with the cosine similarity detector provides promising detection performance.},

abstract={The failure of non-leaf nodes in application layer multicast (ALM) tree partitions the multicast tree, which may significantly degrade the quality of multicast service. Accurate and timely failure recovery from node failures in ALM tree, which is based on the premise of efficient failure detection scheme, is critical to minimize the disruption of service. In fact, failure detection has hardly been studied in the context of ALM. Firstly, this paper analyzes the failure detection issues in ALM and then proposes a model which is based on the relationship between parent and child nodes for it. Secondly, the cooperative-probe based failure detection scheme (CPS), in which the information about probe loss is shared among monitor nodes, is designed. Thirdly, the performance of CPS is analyzed. The Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can simultaneously reduce the detection time and the probability of false positive at the cost of little increased control overhead by comparing with the basic-probe based failure detection scheme (BPS). Finally, some possible directions for the future work are discussed.},

abstract={This paper presents a CPS(Cyber-physical System) home safety architecture for home safety problem detection and reaction and shows some example cases. In order for home safety problem detection, there are three levels of events defined: elementary event, semantic event and entire event, which representing the meaning from parameter to single safety problem, and then the whole safety status of a house. For the relationship between these events and raw data, a Finite State Machine (FSM) based modeling is applied. Including the raw data, these are taken as input and output to the three levels of FSMs. By using this way of event composition, not only single safety problem, but also safety level of the whole house can be precisely described. In order to verify the mechanism of hierarchical FSMs and by using this mechanism, safety problems and safety level of a house can be correctly represented. And also verify that different levels of events can precisely representing what is happening. Two simulation cases are proposed: one is heat stroke and another is carbon monoxide poisoning. The simulation result shows that the simulation targets are satisfied.},

The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.},

abstract={Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition, our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding anomalies, but there is still room for improvement.},

abstract={Devices that monitor and measure various system parameters or physical phenomena form an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Such devices usually operate continuously and gather important data that is often critical for the operation of the underlying system. Thus, it becomes important to understand and detect abnormal or malicious device behavior, false injection of data by an adversary, or other security threats that may lead to incorrect measurement data. This paper addresses the problem of detection of anomalies in diurnal traffic volume data in an intelligent transportation system. The proposed approach leverages the statistical properties of the data to perform anomaly detection by calculating the `local density' of the data points. Anomalous behavior in the traffic volumes reported by road segments is calculated based on sparse local density of the data points. Our approach for detecting anomalies does not require any information about the outside factors which might have influenced the data. The proposed approach has been evaluated on attacks simulated on transportation data collected by the New York State Department of Transportation. The proposed approach also extends to other cyber-physical systems where the monitored data exhibits diurnal patterns.},

abstract={In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Energy theft has been a serious and long existing problem facing by many power utilities. The implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) provides power companies with new means for energy theft detection. As fundamental equipment of AMI, smart meters collect interval measurements from customer sites and thus provide system wide visibility for power companies. Leveraging both AMI and SCADA measurements, this paper puts forward an integrated distribution state estimation method for medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution network. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can achieve a higher accuracy level for estimation. Furthermore, an energy theft detection method is proposed based on "weight-dropped polling" integrated distribution state estimation. Simulations show that it can deliver promising results comparing with conventional state estimation methods.},

abstract={Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring. Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F1 score of respectively > 99%.},

An insider attack occurs when an authorized operator misuse the permissions, and brings catastrophic damages by sending legitimate control commands. Therefore, insider attacks have great impact and higher success rate, and it is difficult to predict and protect against them. This paper, by study on the SCADA alarms, proposes a new alarm based statistical anomaly detection method to identify potential insider attacks at substations and total transmission system in power grid. To demonstrate the proposed method, two insider attack scenarios have been simulated at both substations level and transmission system. Experimental scenarios illustrate proposed method is effective, and anomalies can be detected by minimum number of alarms.},

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism.},

abstract={Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems. Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks. A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI) etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3. The proposed testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its statistical performance is also compared with several conventional quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and false isolation.},

abstract={European Starlings and other bird's flocks in thousands and even millions. Their flocking behaviors attract predators that see such collective behavior as an easy target. However, the surprising thing is that it is harder to target and capture one in their mist than a lone bird. It is easy to target and capture a lone bird than a bird in a flock. One of these collective behaviors is the capability of each of them to detect a predator. Each one in the flock can detect a predator some meters away. The more they are in number, the harder it will be not to detect the incoming predator. This paper proposed modelling the same approach for securing Industrial Control System (ICS) and in particular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, this approach seen in the flock of birds can be replicated in computer system for securing it. Train system was used as a testbed in this paper for data collection. Live data from the train system was collected, analyzed and some risk points were discovered. This risk points were the entry points for anomalies into the system. These are the points that needs securing. The model was to show the viability of using the approach as well as integrating it on SCADA systems, and the train system was a representation of SCADA system. This approach is purely distributed in the sense that each bird is capable of detecting a predator. The detection of anomalies is based on the location of each bird in the system. The bird's environment has cells and each cell has number. The maximum number of birds each cell can contain was six. Six birds approach was used for the detection and this can be seen in the model. Whenever a packet arrives, the first cell that contain six birds will be activated for detection. Birds in the cell has numbers and the activity is based on the number. The results showed that both known and unknow anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems.},

As an increasing number of field devices and computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution, and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.},

abstract={SCADA control systems use programmable logic controller to interface with critical machines. SCADA systems are used in critical infrastructures, for instance, to control smart grid, oil pipelines, water distribution and chemical manufacturing plants: an attacker taking control of a SCADA system could cause various damages, both to the infrastructure but also to people (for instance, adding chemical substances into a water distribution systems). In this paper we propose a method to detect attacks targeting SCADA systems. We exploit model checking, in detail we model logs from SCADA systems into a network of timed automata and, through timed temporal logic, we characterize the behaviour of a SCADA system under attack. Experiments performed on a SCADA water distribution system confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The power SCADA systems have been undergoing several upgrades over the years. At first, these systems were based only on isolated processes, without the need to connect in a global network, such as the Internet. In recent years, the access to such an open network has been critical for the SCADA systems, due to the need for data exchange across large areas, between geographically remote industrial plants, or even because of the demand for remote applications. Despite the SCADA systems have advantages by being now connected to a network such as the Internet, several problems can arise due to that. For example, such a connection makes it possible for an intruder to compromise the whole system. SCADA systems are essential in the new concept of smart grids and are widely used in the monitoring and control of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based on photovoltaics. In that context, this paper presents an overview of the main attacks found and documented in the literature, as well as possible techniques to detect such attacks.},

SCADA systems were originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol communications. The proposed stateful protocol analysis approach is presented that is designed specifically for the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol.

abstract={This paper presents an anomaly detection approach using machine learning to achieve condition monitoring for wind turbines. The approach applies the information in supervisory control and data acquisition systems as data input. First, machine learning is used to estimate the temperature signals of the gearbox component. Then the approach analyzes the deviations between the estimated values and the measurements of the signals. Finally, the information of alarm logs is integrated with the previous analysis to determine the operation states of wind turbines. The proposed approach has been tested with the data experience of a 2MW wind turbine in Sweden. The result demonstrates that the approach can detect possible anomalies before the failure occurrence. It also certifies that the approach can remind operators of the possible changes inside wind turbines even when the alarm logs do not report any alarms.},

abstract={Given the importance of an early anomaly detection, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are introduced in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Agents or probes form the cornerstone of any IDS by capturing network packets and extracting relevant information. However, IDSs are facing unprecedented challenges due to the escalation in the number, scale and diversity of attacks. Software-Defined Network (SDN) then comes into play and can provide the required flexibility and scalability. Building on that, we introduce Traffic Agent Controllers (TACs) that monitor SDN-enabled switches via Open-Flow. By using lightweight statistical metrics such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), we are able to detect the slightest anomalies, such as stealth port scans, even in the presence of background traffic. The obtained metrics can also be used to locate the anomalies with precision over 90% inside a hierarchical network topology.},

pages={341-348},
abstract={Pointer taintedness is a concept which has been successfully employed as basis for vulnerability analysis of C/C ++ source code, and as a run-time mitigation technique against memory corruption attacks. Nevertheless, pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis may have no visibility on certain low-level vulnerabilities since there may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are related to a dynamic organization of data in memory. In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of industrial control protocols.},

Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern.

abstract={Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%.},

This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later, compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.},

abstract={Industrial Control and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks control critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear facilities, and water supply systems. These systems are increasingly the target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS, Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its performance in low performance hardware systems.},

SCADA systems with legacy communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems. The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks.

abstract={The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve. Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be determined.},

abstract={The massive use of information and communication technologies in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of lp-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks.},

abstract={Recently an efficient off-line approach to validate (detect, identify and correct) branch parameter errors using several snapshots of SCADA measurements was developed. This paper extends this approach in order to incorporate synchronized phasor measurements, which are provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Branches suspected of having parameters errors are identified through an Identification Index, which is computed based on the normalized residuals of SCADA and PMU measurements. The suspicious branch parameters are estimated in a sequential form using several measurement snapshots of SCADA and PMU measurements. This estimation process is executed via an augmented state-parameter estimator, which increases the conventional V-θ state vector for the inclusion of suspicious branch parameters. Several test results have demonstrated the high correctness and reliability of the proposed approach to treat single and multiple parameter errors in adjacent and non-adjacent branches and even in branches connected in a radial manner forming critical parameter k-tuples.},

abstract={Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall; accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate may change significantly when considering various attack types and different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical infrastructures.},

abstract={SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) databases have three main features that identify them as big data systems: volume, variety and velocity. SCADAs are extremely important for the safety and security operation of modern power system and provide essential online information about the power system state to system operators. A current research challenge is to efficiently process this big data, which involves real-time measurements of hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important events that affect the system.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems. There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={1-1},
abstract={In recent years, there have been several reports of blade damage caused by lightning strikes on wind turbines. A few of these accidents have resulted in more serious secondary damage owing to the continued rotation of the damaged blades. To prevent the initial damage from spreading in this manner, wind farms in the regions of Japan vulnerable to winter lightning were required to introduce lightning detection systems, which can accurately detect when lightning strikes the wind turbine and then immediately stop the rotation of the blades. Normally, when the system detects a lightning strike to a wind turbine and stops operation, the process of restarting is initiated only after the soundness of the blades is confirmed by visual inspection. However, in bad weather, it is often difficult to check the soundness of the blade visually, and the resulting delay in the restart process prolongs the downtime and reduces the availability of the wind turbine. In this paper, we report the results of using the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data to check the soundness of the blades after a lightning strike to resume operations more quickly, thereby increasing up-time.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data. The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06%, 37.34%, and 26.76% and improves the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57%, 4.19%, and 3.78% using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively.},

In the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units; however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control devices. A support vector of type “Class One” machine and a test lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.},

abstract={Threats that cause malicious function such as information leakage and denial of service by adding hardware trojan (HT) to a device constructed using inexpensive elements at component level after shipment have been reported. The detection method after shipment, which is different from HT detection inside IC is required because of the easiness adding component-level HT to products. The testing method to detect modification on board will achieve the detection of component-level HT. In this brief, we focus on the HT implemented in the wiring connected to integrated circuits. Since the component connection constantly affects the impedance of the wiring, we propose a detection method for such HT implemented outside the IC by measuring the change in the impedance of the wiring. For the detection of malicious modification after shipment it is necessary to excite a pulse signal from the IC that achieves high security, such as a secure microcomputer, and observe the signal reflected inside the secure IC by the discontinuous portion of the impedance on the board. If the reflected signal is different from the shipping test, it can be judged that HT is mounted. We adopted time domain reflectometry (TDR) to realize the above method, and we demonstrate experimental result of component-level HT detection using TDR with measuring instrument and TDR from secure IC. As a result, a significant change in the amplitude due to the impedance change was obtained from the reflected wave measured inside the IC with and without the MOSFET used as the HT using this method.},

abstract={To reduce the excessive power consumption and eliminate the battery voltage imbalance caused in conventional method, a novel broken line detection scheme for Li-ion battery protection integrated circuits (ICs) is presented in this study. The main part of the proposed circuit consists of pull-up, pull-down current source, source-driven MOS, a control switch and a bias current source. A narrow pulse control signal is adopted to trigger broken line detection periodically so as to suppress the detection current consumption, while the disadvantage of battery voltage imbalance is overcome. The proposed circuit has been implemented in a seven cells Li-ion battery protection IC with 0.18 µm 45 V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process successfully. The experimental results confirm that the chip can reliably detect the disconnections of Li-ion batteries and take protective measures in a wide cell voltage range from 2.2 to 4.2 V. Furthermore, based on the derivation in this study, the proposed technique can significantly reduce the detection current consumption of each cell, which is well beneficial for low power consumption and battery voltage balance.},

The problem of fault detection is addressed considering different testing techniques (current monitoring, functional, and delay testing). Electrical simulation has been used to investigate the main differences between BiCMOS and CMOS circuits. It is shown that, because of the large driving capability of BJTs, the detection of bridging faults in BiCMOS circuits is more difficult than in the CMOS case when functional or delay testing is used whereas it becomes more effective when adopting current monitoring.<>},

abstract={The continuous growth of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) poses a serious threat to our critical infrastructures due to their inferior quality and has become one of the major concerns to the government and the industry. Detection of these ICs is challenging especially when they have been used for a short period of time, as the process variations (especially in lower technology nodes) could outpace the degradation caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a robust, accurate, and low-cost solution for efficient detection of recycled ICs, even if they have been used for a very short period of time. The proposed solution utilizes a ring oscillator (RO), and a nonvolatile memory. It stores the RO frequency, conditions (e.g., supply voltage, temperature, and duration) for the frequency measurement, and a digital signature. The simulation and silicon results demonstrate that we can effectively detect recycled ICs used as low as one day.},

This is due to the communication networks between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors, which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a running process, controlled by a PLC, is manipulated without being detected.

abstract={Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC's) 0.35-μm technology, we demonstrate the operation of two hardware Trojans, which leak the secret key of a wireless cryptographic integrated circuit (IC) consisting of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core and an ultrawideband (UWB) transmitter (TX). With their impact carefully hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process variations, these hardware Trojans cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and do not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB TX. Moreover, through physical measurements and MATLAB simulations, we show that the attack facilitated by these hardware Trojans is robust to test equipment and communication channel noise. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of a popular hardware Trojan detection method, namely, statistical side-channel fingerprinting via trained one-class classifiers, in detecting the hardware Trojans introduced in our fabricated IC population.},

Upon detecting a multi-stage attack, our honeypot can generate signatures so that misuse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can subsequently thwart attacks of the same type.

Through exploitation of the chip's physical characteristics, our technique can help detect foundry of origin. We validate our approach on 8051 microcontrollers from three different vendors and utilize principal component analysis to distinguish the acquisitions by vendor.

Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection. It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100% coverage with low false positive rates.},

abstract={In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem. In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8%, 83.3%, 67.9%, and 25.4% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively, for a typical die at 25 °C, compared to baseline frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is suitable for wide-operating-range applications.},

abstract={We introduce a Concurrent Hardware Trojan Detection (CHTD) methodology for wireless cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs), based on continuous extraction of a side-channel fingerprint and evaluation by a trained on-chip neural classifier. While similar statistical side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically, during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is, therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed CHTD methodology effectively identifies hardware Trojans when they are active, while not incurring any false positives when they are absent or dormant.},

abstract={Most of prior hardware Trojan detection approaches require golden chips for references. A classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique has been proposed in the authors' previous work. However, the algorithm in that work is trained by simulated ICs without considering a shift between the simulation and silicon fabrication. In this study, a co-training based hardware Trojan detection method by exploiting inaccurate simulation models and unlabeled fabricated ICs is proposed to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, which eliminates the need of golden chips. Two classification algorithms are trained using simulated ICs. These two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabelled ICs during test-time, and thus can label some of these ICs for the further training of the other algorithm. Moreover, a statistical examination is used to choose ICs labelling for the other algorithm. A statistical confidence interval based technique is also used to combine the hypotheses of the two classification algorithms. Furthermore, the partial least squares method is used to preprocess the raw data of ICs for feature selection. Both EDA experiment results and field programmable gate array (FPGA) experiment results show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy and recall.},

abstract={The counterfeiting and recycling of integrated circuits (ICs) have become major issues in recent years, potentially impacting the security and reliability of electronic systems bound for military, financial, or other critical applications. With identical functionality and packaging, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified.},

abstract={The recycling of used integrated circuits (ICs) has raised serious problems in ensuring the integrity of today's globalized semiconductor supply chain. This poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure due to potentially shorter lifetime, lower reliability, and poorer performance from these counterfeit new chips. Recently, we have proposed a highly effective approach for detecting such chips by exploiting the power-up state of on-chip SRAMs. Due to the symmetry of the memory array layout, an equal number of cells power-up to the 0 and 1 logic states in a new unused SRAM; this ratio gets skewed in time due to uneven NBTI aging from normal usage in the field. Although this solution is very effective in detecting recycled ICs, its applicability is somewhat limited as a large number older designs do not have large on-chip memories. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach based on the initial power-up state of scan flip-flops, which are present in virtually every digital circuit. Since the flip-flops, unlike SRAM cells, are generally not perfectly symmetrical in layout, an equal number of scan cells will not power-up to 0 or 1 logic states in most designs. Consequently, a stable time zero reference of 50% logic 0s and 1s cannot be used for determining the subsequent usage of a chip. To overcome this key limitation, we propose a novel solution in this paper that reliably identifies used ICs from testing the part alone, without the need for any additional reference data or even the netlist of the circuit. Through scan testing of the IC, we first identify a significant number of asymmetrically stressed flip-flops in the design, divided into two groups. One group of flip-flops is selected such that it mostly experiences the 1 logic state during functional operation, while the other group mostly experiences the 0 state. The resulting differential stress during operation causes growing disparity over time in the number of 0s (and 1s) observed in these two groups at power-up. When new and unaged, these two groups behave similarly, with similar percentage of 1s (or 0s). However, over time the differential stress makes these counts diverge. We show that this changing count can be a measure of operational aging. Our simulation results show that it is possible to reliably detect used ICs after as little as three months of operation.},

abstract={In this paper we present an unconventional anti ICS-malware approach. We leverage a factor that appears to be overlooked as of this writing, namely that ICS malware often infect machines which do not run any functions related to industrial process control. These may be, for example, business machines in the enterprise networks of power utility companies, or even random machines on the Internet. Because ICS environments use special-purpose communication protocols, it is highly unlikely that any application code on those machines will send or receive network traffic through an ICS communication protocol. On the other hand, ICS malware discover their targets via searches that initiate ICS communication protocol traffic. Our approach uses a kernel filter driver to analyze the network traffic that flows through a real NIC. The kernel filter driver works with a module that uses in-kernel ICS protocol signatures to recognize ICS protocol traffic embedded within the network traffic in question. Our approach can detect 0-day malware on machines that are unrelated to industrial process control, without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data. We performed extensive testing against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns, as well as safety and efficiency tests, and thus discuss the findings in the paper.},

abstract={The counterfeiting and recycled integrated circuits (ICs) has become a major security threat for commercial and military systems. In addition to the huge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety threats on those systems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight on-chip aging sensor, which is based on the electromigration (EM)-induced aging effects for fast detection and prevention of recycled ICs. Our new EM-based aging sensor exploits the natural aging/failure mechanism of interconnect wires to time the aging of the chip. Compared with existing aging sensor, the new aging sensor can provide more accurate prediction of the chip usage time at smaller area footprints due to its simple structure. The new sensor is based on a newly proposed physics-based stress evolution model of EM effects for accurate prediction of the EM failure. As a result, we can design the interconnect wire structures based on copper interconnect technology so that the resulting wires will have detectable EM failure at a specific time with sufficient accuracy. In order to mitigate the problem of the inherent variations in the metal grain sizes and assess its impacts on the nucleation time of metal wires, a number of parallel properly structured wires are used in the sensor. The parameters of the wires are optimized using the new EM model. Our statistical and variational analysis shows that the proposed aging sensor can accurately predict the targeted failure times in the presence of both inherent uncertainties. Our study also shows that more parallel wires will lead to more accurate statistical predictions at costs of more areas.},

Second, the new sensor combines both the ring-oscillator based aging sensor with recently proposed electromigration(EM)-based aging sensor so that it can be effective for estimation of both short and long period time of chip usage. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs.

abstract={In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time.},

abstract={In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA) is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of SVM parameters selection.},

abstract={Physical attacks focus on extracting information from internal parts of IC's. One way to achieve this is by means of connecting probes to wires, so that the content of internal buses and registers can be revealed. Protection against this type of attacks exists, but usually is bulky and expensive, e.g. the shielding of secured areas. This paper presents a novel in-circuit countermeasure that is cheap and can easily be integrated in existing designs to detect probing attempts. It is based on a ring oscillator that operates over coupled lines in a differential mode. When the loading of one of the lines is unbalanced over a tolerance margin, an impulse is generated and integrated over time. If the integration surpasses a given threshold an alarm signal is activated. Simulations show the stability of the detector over a range of temperature and supply voltage variations.},

abstract={Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans. Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips. First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs. During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy (92%~97%) and recall (88%~95%).},

pages={2156-2165},
abstract={A wideband microwave method is described as a means for rapid detection of slight dissimilarities and aging effects in integrated circuits (ICs). The method is based on measuring the complex reflection coefficient of an IC when illuminated with an open-ended rectangular waveguide probe, at K-band (18-26.5 GHz) and Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz) microwave frequencies. The spatially integrated reflected electromagnetic signature of a given IC is a function of its internal material properties, geometry and metallic deposition of circuit element, and wire bonds. Consequently, dissimilar (including counterfeit) and aged ICs exhibit markedly different reflection properties than their reference and new (nonaged) counterparts. In addition to measuring spatially integrated complex reflection coefficient (over the waveguide aperture), it is also integrated over the operating frequency band (spectrally integrated), resulting in significant increase in the robustness of the approach. Root-mean-squared-error, defined as the average Euclidean distance between two reflection coefficient vectors, is used to associate a quantitative metric to the complex reflection coefficient difference between two dissimilar ICs. Measurement results on several sets of ICs having the same package (DIP-14) and different functionalities, similar functionalities with slight differences in specifications, and aged ICs are presented. The results clearly indicate the capability of this method to differentiate among ICs having slight differences in packaging material properties and/or electronic circuitry.},

In the first step, we use Q signals of flip-flops in a circuit to increase the number of reachable states. In the second step, we partition these flip-flops into different groups enhancing the state-space variation. Creation of these new reachable states helps to trigger and propagate the Trojan effect more easily. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show that this method can effectively uncover Trojans which are otherwise very difficult to detect in the normal functional mode. In addition, partitioning the flip-flops of the circuit into different groups and selecting the output (Q or Q) based on input controlled ENABLE signals conceal its actual functionality beyond simple recognition thereby making it difficult for the adversary to implant Trojans.},

year={2020},

pages={885-894},
abstract={For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and validation can be carried out efficiently. Existing acceleration techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about 105× acceleration) under the 150 °C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.},

abstract={Interconnect imperfections have become an issue in modern nanometer technologies. Some of them cause Small Delay Defects (SDDs) which are difficult to detect. Furthermore, those SDDs not detected during testing may pose a reliability problem. Nanometer issues (e.g. process variations, spatial correlations) represent important challenges for traditional delay test methods. In this paper, a technique to compute the probability of detection of resistive opens causing SDDs considering process variations is proposed. This technique is used to estimate the Statistical Fault Coverage (SFC) of a circuit. In order to estimate the SFC of a circuit, the delays are propagated using statistical timing analysis, and the analyzed space of possible delay fault locations is obtained using stratified sampling techniques. This methodology is applied to some ISCAS benchmark circuits. The obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Measures can be taken for those circuits presenting non-acceptable fault coverage in order to improve their test quality.},

abstract={The algorithm of causal anomaly detection in industrial control physics is proposed to determine the normal cloud line of industrial control system so as to accurately detect the anomaly. In this paper, The causal modeling algorithm combining Maximum Information Coefficient and Transfer Entropy was used to construct the causal network among nodes in the system. Then, the abnormal nodes and the propagation path of the anomaly are deduced from the structural changes of the causal network before and after the attack. Finally, an anomaly detection algorithm based on hybrid differential cumulative is used to identify the specific anomaly data in the anomaly node. The stability of causality mining algorithm and the validity of locating causality anomalies are verified by using the data of classical chemical process. Experimental results show that the anomaly detection algorithm is better than the comparison algorithm in accuracy, false negative rate and recall rate, and the anomaly location strategy makes the anomaly source traceable.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) now usually connect to Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet, exposing them to security threats resulting from cyber-attacks. However, detecting such attacks is non-trivial task. The high-dimensional network data pose significant challenges on security anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a network flow data processing method, which can make the complex network data more standardized and unified to assist security anomaly detection. Then, data generation method is applied to collect enough training data. We also propose a evaluation method for generated data. Finally, the bidirectional recurrent neural networks with attention mechanism is proposed to extract the latent feature, and give an explainable results in identifying the dominant attributes. Empirical results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects in today's and future sub-10nm ICs, one critical issue is how to create stressing conditions so that the chip will fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM signoff and validation can be carried out efficiently. In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration techniques for practical VLSI chips. We will first review the recently proposed three-phase physics-based EM models and discuss the important factors contributing to the EM aging process. Then we propose a new formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing temperature. On average, 10% increase in temperature yields about 10X wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM, and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10 years down to a few hours (about 105 acceleration) under the 150°C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.},

abstract={Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control devices. The control devices are interconnected via modern control communication bus such as ModbusTCP which now leverages Ethernet to allow interoperability between different solutions and vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. This presentation discusses diversified redundant architecture as a cyber-resilient system for networked control devices which maintains their normal operation even under compromised situations. This operation-based resilient architecture adds an isolated device, functionally equivalent to the networked primary device but with essential safe-mode operation features only, which is naturally immune to cyber incidents. In addition, a supervisor component monitors the operation of both networked and isolated devices, and transfers control to the safe-mode isolated device if the networked device operates abnormally, assuming that the abnormal operation is resulted from malicious hacking which has not been detected from the network cyber security defense. However, even with its resiliency, the diversified architecture has its own blind side — unawareness of presence of hacking traffic on the control bus when operational changes are not made by the hackers. Therefore, to solve this problem of unawareness of and undetected intrusion, we improve the architecture with an additional feature of intrusion detection utilizing open source software called Snort. The security features of Snort are incorporated as an intrusion detection and awareness solution, and are customized into the supervisor component of the diversified architecture for Modbus TCP/IP traffic monitoring. In laboratory tests, the added feature of intrusion detection has successfully initiated a safe-mode control transfer to the isolated device upon detection of unusual data traffic on the control bus. With this bus monitoring and intrusion detection, the diversified architecture would become a truly resilient and secure networked industrial control system.},
