abstract={Cyber physical systems (CPS) are process control systems interacting with the cyber world. Once connected to the internet, they become prone to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved. Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model. Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base will be first trained using simulated data of the system including faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained, real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge base using comparator to detect anomalies. On detection of abnormal data, they will then be further identified as faults or attacks.},

The paper involves the proposed method for breast cancer detection using imaging techniques such as mammography and thermography. The computer aided diagnosis tool is used as an efficient method to segment and classify the digital images. The data accessing for clinicians is difficult to due limited medical care in rural areas. Cyber-physical system (CPS) relates the virtual and physical world. CPS aids in integrating network, interacting between human and system, provides high flexibility, scalability and optimization.

abstract={In the hierarchical control paradigm of a smart grid cyber-physical system, decentralized local agents (LAs) can potentially be compromised by opportunistic attackers to manipulate electricity prices for illicit financial gains. In this paper, to address such opportunistic attacks, we propose a Dirichlet-based detection scheme, where a Dirichlet-based probabilistic model is built to assess the reputation levels of LAs. Initial reputation levels of the LAs are first trained using the proposed model, based on their historical operating observations. An adaptive detection algorithm with reputation incentive mechanism is then employed to detect opportunistic attackers. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed scheme using data collected from the IEEE 39-bus power system with the PowerWorld simulator.},

abstract={In this research, we proposed a process-based anomaly detection method for Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Our method performs relaxation on monitoring the data and focuses more on the relationship of the execution order of message passing between the devices in the MQTT-based network. First, we performed a `bird's eye' monitoring technique to discover the execution order of message passing in the MQTT network with process mining. Then, we grasp the structure of the process model with a tree model called a process tree. Using the process tree, we check the deviations of normal behavior's process tree and the monitored behavior's process tree. Since CPS is a closed-loop system and MQTT protocol has pre-specified execution, we can easily detect deviations in the process tree as an anomaly. However, it is still hard to perform forensic analysis. Next, we proposed a forensic analysis method, which comes as an advantage of this approach compared to the black-boxed detection method, such as machine learning. The process-based approach can backtrack message passing by traversing the process tree and identify the execution operator in the parent nodes to find affected devices and execution order related to the incident. Finally, we showed an application example and evaluation of our method.},

abstract={Timely and automatic detection and reconstruction of cyber attack is crucial in maintaining safe operation of cyber-physical systems. This study investigates the problem of unexpected cyber attack and its automatic recovery. First, detectability of attacks based on linear system theory is explored and some sufficient conditions of detecting state attacks and sensor attacks, respectively, are established. Subsequently two adaptive sliding mode observers with on line parameter estimation are designed to estimate state attacks and sensor attacks separately. Second, appropriate residual signals are constructed and it is shown that they approach to the attacks with ultimately uniformly bounded errors. Finally, as an illustration of attack detection and reconstruction, the results are applied to an IEEE 39 bus power system with 10 generators and 39 buses, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive schemes.},

Cyber Physical Systems for smart environments have great potential in providing context-aware, automated support in everyday life of people that need adaptive occupational therapy. We present a method and program-based algorithm for the detection and analysis of periodic activities of subjects performing physical exercises from video sequences. The algorithm detects the beginning of a series of exercises of a given type, measures the duration of each of them, detects the end of the sequence and measures the number of repetitions.

abstract={Stroke is one of the fatal diseases that affect the brain and causes death within 3 to 10 h. However, most of the deaths caused by a stroke can be avoided with the identification of the nature of stroke and react to it in a timely manner by intelligent health systems. The state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) enable interaction between physical and computational world to identify any anomaly in the physical world and respond to it. The response of CPS may vary depending upon the context of the physical world. Extensive research has been done in this area from the perspective of wireless sensor networks, body area networks, and wearable smart devices. This paper proposes a CPS for detecting the occurrence of stroke in patients, who have a high risk of stroke or have survived a stroke before. The developed CPS sends recorded data to the doctor and alerts him when the stroke occurs. The proposed system is operating on data acquired from electroencephalography sensors from patients' brain. This article aimed at decreasing human mortality rate due to stroke and will bridge the gaps in CPS due to interdisciplinary isolation. The disciplines involved in the development of a CPS include communication networks, pattern recognition, software engineering, mathematics, and biomedical.},

abstract={With the advent of 5G, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) employed in the vertical industries and critical infrastructures will depend on the cellular network more than ever; making their attack surface wider. Hence, guarding the network against cyber-attacks is critical not only for its primary subscribers but to prevent it from being exploited as a proxy to attack CPSs. In this study, we propose a consolidated framework, by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and real network data, to provide early-detection for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks orchestrated by a botnet that controls malicious devices. These puppet devices individually perform silent call, signaling, SMS spamming, or a blend of these attacks targeting call, Internet, SMS, or a blend of these services, respectively, to cause a collective DDoS attack in a cell that can disrupt CPSs' operations. Our results demonstrate that our framework can achieve higher than 91% normal and under-attack cell detection accuracy.},

Cyber Physical System is one of the blooming technologies with wide range of applications. Currently the interest towards design and implementation of CPS is highly increasing. It is expected that CPS will play a vital role in the progress of upcoming embedded systems. In this paper we have proposed a system to provide efficient and quick solution to heart attack patients who are at great risk. Advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has created an enormous impact on the current medical health care scenario. It has enabled the design of small sized wireless communication systems at low cost. A small wearable wireless monitoring system inspects the patient's ECG signals continuously and transmits the signals to decision making and control systems. The control system is capable of controlling the actuation system which is fitted to the body of the patients. The warning system sends an alert in case of emergency to the caretakers mobile. Our proposed system uses low cost, energy efficient and reliable zigbee technology for communication among the physical components and hence the effectiveness of the system is improved. This life saving system reduces the mortality rate of heart patients and it act as an effective heart care service to patients.},

pages={2126-2137},
abstract={Bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, and fingerprint, are ideal for establishing authentication in the futuristic networks, such as the medical cyber physical systems (MCPSs). In such a network, to authenticate and classify the bio-modalities, raw data would be traditionally sent to the cloud other than the proximal devices as they are resource-constrained. Thus, the centralized cloud-based solution not only incurs significant delay but also violates the data privacy as the data are moved to the cloud. In recent years, privacy-preserving on-device AI nodes are getting attention to solve certain classification problem, which can also be applied for classifying spoofed and real bio-modalities for authentication. To this end, we propose an on-device AI-based MCPS architecture, where the on-device AI node runs a light-weight but powerful classification algorithm, as we call it the feature-augmented random forest (FA-RF). The FA-RF combines the power of random forest with feature selection and a proposed feature augmentation mechanism. Besides privacy-preserving of the raw data, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the communication delay imposed on the network as cloud computation and communication is removed. Our proposal is verified on real datasets of the face, iris, and fingerprint bio-modalities provided by the Warsaw, Replay-Attack, and LiveDet 2015 Crossmatch benchmark, respectively. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art architectures in four out of six tests. Besides, we show that the FA-RF can significantly reduce the training and testing time in both the cloud and the on-device AI node.},

abstract={Bio-modalities are ideal for user authentication in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems. Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained, heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors. Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis. Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS. In this regard, we propose a machine learning based security algorithm run as an application at the fog node using a binarized multi-factor boosted ensemble learner algorithm coupled with feature selection. Our proposal is verified on real datasets provided by the Replay Attack, Warsaw and LiveDet 2015 Crossmatch benchmark for face, iris and fingerprint modality spoofing detection used for authentication in an MCPS. The experimental analysis shows that our approach achieves significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract={The emerging smart grid, cyber-physical infrastructure, provides a steady, secure, and reliable power system over the current power grid. Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120 samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the algorithm.

abstract={Vibration fault detection becomes increasingly used for economical and safety reasons. However, current research reveals some problems such as low accuracy of fault detection, few effective in-depth calculation of vibration data and few flexible architectures in that area. In this paper, a vibration fault detection Cyber-Physical System (CPS)with service support (S-VFDCPS) is presented. From the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) point of view, S-VFDCPS consists of enterprise level, gateway level and endpoint level, with relevant vibration detection services on each level. From the Cyber-Physical system (CPS) point of view, it contains three layers: the monitoring and control layer, the network layer and the device layer. Data processing algorithms and services are proposed quantifying the criteria of fault evaluation. It is shown by testing results that our proposed approach and the improvement in design make S-VFDCPS more flexible and accurate in real-time vibration fault detection.},

pages={3311-3321},
abstract={In this article, an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) is utilized for monitoring critical events such as structural equipment conditions in industrial environments. Such a system can easily be a point of attraction for the cyberattackers, in addition to system faults, severe resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy), and environmental problems. This makes data collection in the ICPS untrustworthy, even the data are altered after the data forwarding. Without validating this before data aggregation, detection of an event through the aggregation in the ICPS can be difficult. This article introduces TrustData, a scheme for high-quality data collection for event detection in the ICPS, referred to as “Trust worthy and secured Data collection” scheme. It alleviates authentic data for accumulation at groups of sensor devices in the ICPS. Based on the application requirements, a reduced quantity of data is delivered to an upstream node, say, a cluster head. We consider that these data might have sensitive information, which is vulnerable to being altered before/after transmission. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, we provide the concept of TrustData to verify whether or not the acquired data are trustworthy (unaltered) before transmission, and whether or not the transmitted data are secured (data privacy is preserved) before aggregation. Second, we utilize a general measurement model that helps to verify acquired signal untrustworthy before transmitting toward upstream nodes. Finally, we provide an extensive performance analysis through a real-world dataset, and our results prove the effectiveness of TrustData.},

Protecting data from unwanted access by modifying it through cryptography, hiding data or digitally signing it are some of the solutions available. Just as important however is to detect and prevent attacks. We propose a system with hierarchical access to data which is gained through a digital signature algorithm. We focus our attention on detecting and preventing attacks through a less conventional method - complex event processing. Any action within the cyber-physical system can be viewed as an event, such as digitally signing a message.

abstract={Paroxysmal diseases of inpatients are globally recognized as one of the top challenges in medicine. Poor clinical outcomes are primarily caused by delayed recognition, especially due to diverse clinical diagnostic criteria with complex manifestations, irregular episodes, and already overloaded clinical activities. With the proliferation of measuring devices and increased computational capabilities, cyber-physical characterization plays an increasingly important role in many domains to provide enabling technologies. This paper presents a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework to assist physicians in making earlier diagnoses of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity based on existing medical knowledge. We propose a configurable diagnostic knowledge model to characterize clinical criteria to reduce domain knowledge deficiency between physicians and computer scientists. We present a component-based medical CPS framework to employ the knowledge models and integrate medical devices. Our approach aims to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and to provide timely decision support. We evaluate our approach on 128 realworld clinical cases. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, the results demonstrate that we enable early detection in 11.02% more patients and detect the condition 16.57 hours earlier on average.},

abstract={In the engineering of cyber-physical systems the engineering process typically focuses on single systems and not on the entire system network. Within the system network the different specification artifacts (in consequence also the implemented systems) for the various cyber-physical systems evolve independently even though they highly interact with each other. As a result, inconsistencies between the different specification artifacts can emerge. An inconsistency implies that at least one artifact is incorrect. Following, specification inconsistencies among single cyber-physical systems within an entire system network endanger correct functioning of the network. Hence, it is of importance to identify all existing inconsistencies and to correct the corresponding artifacts. Therefore, this paper suggests a solution concept for supporting the identification and repair of inconsistencies in interaction-based specification artifacts. The approach relies (i) on the automated detection of inconsistencies among overlapping specification artifacts of different systems participating in the same cyber-physical network, and (ii) on the automated proposal of valid solution options to aid the engineers in decision making w.r.t. resolving the inconsistencies. In this paper, we apply the solution idea to ITU message sequence charts as a typical notation format for interaction-based behavioral specification artifacts of cyber-physical systems.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel improved coherently integrated cubic phase function (ICI-CPF) algorithm is proposed for the cubic phase signal (CPS). The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. Firstly, transform the CPS to the lag-frequency domain, in which auto-terms are concentrated into straight lines passing through the origin of the two-dimensional plane. Based on this important property, the auto-terms are coherently accumulated along the straight lines. Finally, search the distinct peaks in the chirp rate (CR)-quadratic chirp rate (QCR) domain, and estimate the CR and QCR, simultaneously. ICICPF algorithm can be proved to be with well auto-term accumulation and cross-term suppression capabilities by theory analysis and simulations. Besides, compared with several existing algorithms, it shows superior anti-noise performance and acceptable computation complexity. Based on ICICPF algorithm, a novel multi-component CPS detection method is presented, which is able to eliminate the shadow effect among the components and realize the components detection. Simulations and real measured data processing results proves its validity.},

abstract={Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is an important clinical problem of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which incurs approximately 90% of all TBI-related costs. However, current detection approach is hampered by no consensus clinical diagnostic criteria, paroxysmal episode feature with complex manifestations, and already overloaded clinical activities. These limitations cause delayed recognitions which result in poor clinical outcomes. In this paper, we design an integrated Medical Cyber-Physical System (Medical CPS) for early detection of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity patients. First, a formal model is proposed to describe clinical diagnostic criteria. With the formalized models employed, we implement an early detector and integrate it with revised medical device adapters into Medical CPS. Our system will monitor patient conditions automatically and continuously to relieve medical staff from the heavy burden of clinical activities and provide timely decision supports. Evaluations on 107 clinical cases extracted from medical publications demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our integrated system.},

abstract={These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can execute illegal operations within the normal network communication defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work, we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state. We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection rules.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are more vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks than the conventional systems because of the tight integration of the cyber, communication and control aspects of CPS. Deceptive attacks are very severe on such systems because they go undetected when classical detectors like chi-squared detector is used. Once such deceptive attack that we focus in this paper are false data injection attacks, where the attacker inputs carefully designed false attack vectors. Chi-square detector which detects based on the statistics of deviations of the residual i.e. difference of observed measurement and estimated measurement fails to detect these attacks, since the statistics is not changed in these attacks. “Cosine similarity detector” was proposed to detect False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in smart grid scenario. However, we show that there exists attack vectors that remain stealthy to both chi-square as well as the cosine-square detectors. We propose an random coding scheme to modify the measurements at random, unknown to the attacker while known to the estimator. We establish that our coding scheme in conjunction with the cosine similarity detector provides promising detection performance.},

abstract={Invalid pointer dereferences, such as null pointer dereferences, dangling pointer dereferences and double frees, are a prevalent source of software bugs in CPS software, due to flexible dereferencing pointers along various pointer fields. Existing tools have high overhead or are incomplete, thereby limiting their efficiency in checking the kind of CPS software with shared and mutable memory. In this paper, we present a novel extended pointer structure for detecting all invalid pointer dereferences in this kind of CPS software. We propose an invalid pointer dereferences detection algorithm based on the uniform transformation of abstract heap states. Experimental evaluation about a set of large C benchmark programs shows that the proposed approach is sufficiently efficient in detecting invalid pointer dereferences of CPS software with shared and mutable memory.},

abstract={The failure of non-leaf nodes in application layer multicast (ALM) tree partitions the multicast tree, which may significantly degrade the quality of multicast service. Accurate and timely failure recovery from node failures in ALM tree, which is based on the premise of efficient failure detection scheme, is critical to minimize the disruption of service. In fact, failure detection has hardly been studied in the context of ALM. Firstly, this paper analyzes the failure detection issues in ALM and then proposes a model which is based on the relationship between parent and child nodes for it. Secondly, the cooperative-probe based failure detection scheme (CPS), in which the information about probe loss is shared among monitor nodes, is designed. Thirdly, the performance of CPS is analyzed. The Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can simultaneously reduce the detection time and the probability of false positive at the cost of little increased control overhead by comparing with the basic-probe based failure detection scheme (BPS). Finally, some possible directions for the future work are discussed.},

For the relationship between these events and raw data, a Finite State Machine (FSM) based modeling is applied. Including the raw data, these are taken as input and output to the three levels of FSMs. By using this way of event composition, not only single safety problem, but also safety level of the whole house can be precisely described. In order to verify the mechanism of hierarchical FSMs and by using this mechanism, safety problems and safety level of a house can be correctly represented. And also verify that different levels of events can precisely representing what is happening. Two simulation cases are proposed: one is heat stroke and another is carbon monoxide poisoning. The simulation result shows that the simulation targets are satisfied.},

abstract={Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.},

abstract={Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition, our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding anomalies, but there is still room for improvement.},

abstract={Devices that monitor and measure various system parameters or physical phenomena form an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Such devices usually operate continuously and gather important data that is often critical for the operation of the underlying system. Thus, it becomes important to understand and detect abnormal or malicious device behavior, false injection of data by an adversary, or other security threats that may lead to incorrect measurement data. This paper addresses the problem of detection of anomalies in diurnal traffic volume data in an intelligent transportation system. The proposed approach leverages the statistical properties of the data to perform anomaly detection by calculating the `local density' of the data points. Anomalous behavior in the traffic volumes reported by road segments is calculated based on sparse local density of the data points. Our approach for detecting anomalies does not require any information about the outside factors which might have influenced the data. The proposed approach has been evaluated on attacks simulated on transportation data collected by the New York State Department of Transportation. The proposed approach also extends to other cyber-physical systems where the monitored data exhibits diurnal patterns.},
