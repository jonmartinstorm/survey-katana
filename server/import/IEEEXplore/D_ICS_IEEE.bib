abstract={In recent years, the number of information security incidents of industry controlling system has increased dramatically. The intrusion detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive attention. As one of powerful and light weight Network Intrusion Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP is very important for the industry controlling systems which use Profinet to connect. To realize the detection for Profinet RT signal, this paper expanded the snort packet decoding engine, and designed a preprocessor plug-ins for Profinet RT signal. Experimental result shows that the improved Snort can support the intrusion detection for Profinet RT signal.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are related to all aspects of human life and have become the target of many cyber-attackers. Attacks on industrial control systems may not only cause monetary loss, but also damage equipment, the environment and hurt staff, such as the Stuxnet and the cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid. So the intrusion detection of ICS has a great significance. This paper based on the intrusion detection by telemetry analysis, optimized the system model, captured the communication packets between different nodes in the system, then extracted features for machine learning to achieve malicious traffic detection, and the attack types are further distinguished. Telemetry means that it does not need to enter the industrial control system network, but by capturing data packets remotely to achieve intrusion detection.},

In this paper, a physical intrusion detection method is proposed for ICS, by analyzing the communication signal at physical layer. RS485, one of the most important and widely-used serial bus, is selected to investigate how the intruded devices influence the voltage signal in ICS network. The model of voltage signal in RS485 communication lines is built to represent the difference caused by the variation of devices and detect the intruded devices.

abstract={The integration of communication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) increases their vulnerability towards cyber-attacks, causing devastating outcomes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are mainly developed to support information technology systems, count vastly on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber-attacks. Besides, most IDSs do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thereby suffering from low accuracy and high false-positive when being put to use. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to construct new balanced representations of the imbalanced datasets. The new representations are fed into an ensemble deep learning attack detection model specifically designed for an ICS environment. The proposed attack detection model leverages Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to detect cyber-attacks from the new representations. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on 10-fold cross-validation on two real ICS datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), DNN, and AdaBoost, as well as recent existing models in the literature. The proposed approach is a generalized technique, which can be implemented in existing ICS infrastructures with minimum effort.},

abstract={In view of the problem that the intrusion detection method based on One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) could not detect the outliers within the industrial data, which results in the decision function deviating from the training sample, an anomaly intrusion detection algorithm based on Robust Incremental Principal Component Analysis (RIPCA) -OCSVM is proposed in this paper. The method uses RIPCA algorithm to remove outliers in industrial data sets and realize dimensionality reduction. In combination with the advantages of OCSVM on the single classification problem, an anomaly detection model is established, and the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) is used for model parameter optimization. The simulation results show that the method can efficiently and accurately identify attacks or abnormal behaviors while meeting the real-time requirements of the industrial control system (ICS).},

abstract={The nature of the traffic in industrial control system network is markedly different from more open networks. Industrial control system networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of. In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network. A set of possible features to be used for detecting anomalies is studied for this environment.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) used in industrial plants are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can cause fatal damage to the plants. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor ICS network traffic and detect suspicious activities. However, many IDSs overlook sophisticated cyber-attacks because it is hard to make a complete database of cyber-attacks and distinguish operational anomalies when compared to an established baseline. In this paper, a discriminant model between normal and anomalous packets was constructed with a support vector machine (SVM) based on an ICS communication profile, which represents only packet intervals and length, and an IDS with the applied model is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed IDS was evaluated using penetration tests on our cyber security test bed. Although the IDS was constructed by the limited features (intervals and length) of packets, the IDS successfully detected cyber-attacks by monitoring the rate of predicted attacking packets.},

abstract={Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used “air-gap” security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect. Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted through the network but is not inherently the data used by the transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker and engineer on the Internet.},

The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic. SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false negative.},

abstract={Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage Ethernet to allow interoperability between solutions from different vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect, created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets. This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyberdefensive architecture by using a Raspberry Pi based ModbusTCP control system that enables simulation of cyber-attacks, and illustrates a mitigation measure with the added feature of Modbus monitoring using Snort.},

abstract={Detecting process-based attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) is challenging. These cyber-attacks are designed to disrupt the industrial process by changing the state of a system, while keeping the system's behaviour close to the expected behaviour. Such anomalous behaviour can be effectively detected by an event-driven approach. Petri Net (PN) model identification has proved to be an effective method for event-driven system analysis and anomaly detection. However, PN identification-based anomaly detection methods require ICS device logs to be converted into event logs (sequence of events). Therefore, in this paper we present a formalised method for pre-processing and transforming ICS device logs into event logs. The proposed approach outperforms the previous methods of device logs processing in terms of anomaly detection. We have demonstrated the results using two published datasets.},

abstract={Industrial realize that SCADA System was built without considering the security aspect. It was believe that there will be no attacks go to the SCADA plant using malware, such as botnet. Botnets are now the key platform for many Internet attacks, such as spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing. Most of the current botnet detection approaches work only on specific botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as botnets change their C&C techniques. In this research, we study vertexnet malware attack on a SCADA Server so that it can identify a SCADA Operator machine. The identification was used by analyzing and comparing process list which is run on the infecting host, so the attacker didn't take the wrong target, taking over the SCADA and sending some command to disrupt or operate the plant or machine, and to identifying of Botnet Vertexnet function and activity. From the experiment conducted, we get result that botnet Vertexnet can identifying SCADA Operator, taking over the server, and the activity can be detected effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The device fingerprinting- based intrusion classification and detection approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.},

These sequences are excerpts from the output of a stream cipher that is embedded in the protected chip and parameterized by a secret unique key. The key initialization is done by a trusted party after manufacturing. For IC verification, the end user measures the side channel leakage of the chip under test. The chip is assessed to be genuine if the end user finds a significant correlation between the observed side channel leakage and several previously published identification sequences. We provide a proof of concept implementation on an FPGA using the hardware-tailored stream cipher Trivium. Our results show that for the cost of a small number of logic gates, we can determine in the field whether an IC is genuine by measuring the electromagnetic emanation of the chip using low-cost equipment.},

abstract={A testing structure was developed to more effectively detect the poly stringer defects in contemporary CMOS ICs. This structure is much more sensitive to poly stringer defects and is closer to the real product layout than the currently widely used structure using an active dummy underneath a poly comb. Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 μn foundries process detect were stringers to characterize the processing design with the process testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width. This structure can be used to identify new designs for manufacturing rules for the active space. Thus, this method is very useful for IC foundries to detect poly stringers and to characterize the processing line isolation and tune the process recipe to improve product yields.},

abstract={Increasing test coverage of power integrity in manufacturing test of 3D-ICs is necessary to achieve zero DPPM (Defect Parts Per Million) in the market. Although only functional tests are applied to analog circuits such as power distribution networks in general, applying structural tests will increase the coverage. This paper proposes to measure resistance between a pair of bumps under TSVs (Through Silicon Vias) to detect open defects of the TSVs as a part of structural power integrity test. Diagnostic performance of each bump pair is evaluated by simulations and the best one is selected to detect each TSV defect. Resistance threshold for the defect detection is determined considering trade-off between fault coverage and yield loss. Experimental simulations of power distribution network in a 3DIC with 2 dies are conducted and the trade-off between them is derived.},

abstract={Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about 250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by using the proposed methodology.},

abstract={Defects in through-silicon vias (TSVs) due to fabrication steps decrease the yield and reliability of 3-D stacked integrated circuits, and hence these defects need to be detected early to reduce chip's DPM. In this paper, a new fault detection and repair method for TSVs in 3D-ICs is proposed. The contribution of the method is to detect stuck-at-faults and delay-based fault in TSV by a scan-based built-in self-test (BIST) architecture. This test architecture supports both pre-bond and post-bond TSV testing. By constructing RC model and analyzing the delay characteristics of TSV, the variation of TSV-to-substrate resistance caused by TSV defects can be mapped to the change of path delay so that the related fault can be detected. Based on the test architecture, we propose a TSV redundancy structure to repair circuit after failed TSVs are detected. Results of fault detection effectiveness are presented through ModelSim simulations using realistic models under 65 nm CMOS technology. And redundancy design leads to 99.9846% recovery rate for TSVs with only 0.2% redundancy rate of TSVs.},

This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics, communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to detect trojan effects. We also provide experimental results.},

pages={150-152},
abstract={Traditional testing is based on applying signals to circuit inputs and observing logic stale of outputs. However, with the introduction of CMOS technology a new test technique emerged, that is based on applying signal inputs and observing standby electrical current. This technique is known as IDDQ testing. In most CMOS circuits, when all inputs are frozen in place and circuit transient activities settle down, the current drops by 3-5 orders of magnitude below normal levels. During testing, if there is a deviation from this behavior a defect is detected. While parametric test of electric current has always been popular (including in bipolar and NMOS technologies) to detect a short between power supply lines, the promise of IDDQ test is that it will also allow detection of bridging between signal nets and transistor stuck-on faults in CMOS circuits. However, in reality, the resolution of the size of the defect is limited by the magnitude of stand-by current. Since normal process variation can cause a shift in stand-by current by two orders of magnitude, choosing a single threshold for IDDQ defect detection is impractical. Many ideas have been proposed to overcome this problem, most of which are based on choosing an adaptive cut-off point for a wafer, or a lot. In this paper, we suggest a technique, that in concept, is akin to setting an individual cutoff point for a die. The concept has been validated based on actual data.},

abstract={Threats that cause malicious function such as information leakage and denial of service by adding hardware trojan (HT) to a device constructed using inexpensive elements at component level after shipment have been reported. The detection method after shipment, which is different from HT detection inside IC is required because of the easiness adding component-level HT to products. The testing method to detect modification on board will achieve the detection of component-level HT. In this brief, we focus on the HT implemented in the wiring connected to integrated circuits. Since the component connection constantly affects the impedance of the wiring, we propose a detection method for such HT implemented outside the IC by measuring the change in the impedance of the wiring. For the detection of malicious modification after shipment it is necessary to excite a pulse signal from the IC that achieves high security, such as a secure microcomputer, and observe the signal reflected inside the secure IC by the discontinuous portion of the impedance on the board. If the reflected signal is different from the shipping test, it can be judged that HT is mounted. We adopted time domain reflectometry (TDR) to realize the above method, and we demonstrate experimental result of component-level HT detection using TDR with measuring instrument and TDR from secure IC. As a result, a significant change in the amplitude due to the impedance change was obtained from the reflected wave measured inside the IC with and without the MOSFET used as the HT using this method.},

abstract={To reduce the excessive power consumption and eliminate the battery voltage imbalance caused in conventional method, a novel broken line detection scheme for Li-ion battery protection integrated circuits (ICs) is presented in this study. The main part of the proposed circuit consists of pull-up, pull-down current source, source-driven MOS, a control switch and a bias current source. A narrow pulse control signal is adopted to trigger broken line detection periodically so as to suppress the detection current consumption, while the disadvantage of battery voltage imbalance is overcome. The proposed circuit has been implemented in a seven cells Li-ion battery protection IC with 0.18 µm 45 V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process successfully. The experimental results confirm that the chip can reliably detect the disconnections of Li-ion batteries and take protective measures in a wide cell voltage range from 2.2 to 4.2 V. Furthermore, based on the derivation in this study, the proposed technique can significantly reduce the detection current consumption of each cell, which is well beneficial for low power consumption and battery voltage balance.},

abstract={This paper presents a study of the effects on the electrical behavior of BiCMOS digital circuits induced by bridging faults, whose resistance value is shown to have a strong impact on the static and dynamic behavior of faulty gates and of their fan-out gates. The problem of fault detection is addressed considering different testing techniques (current monitoring, functional, and delay testing). Electrical simulation has been used to investigate the main differences between BiCMOS and CMOS circuits. It is shown that, because of the large driving capability of BJTs, the detection of bridging faults in BiCMOS circuits is more difficult than in the CMOS case when functional or delay testing is used whereas it becomes more effective when adopting current monitoring.<>},

abstract={The continuous growth of recycled integrated circuits (ICs) poses a serious threat to our critical infrastructures due to their inferior quality and has become one of the major concerns to the government and the industry. Detection of these ICs is challenging especially when they have been used for a short period of time, as the process variations (especially in lower technology nodes) could outpace the degradation caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a robust, accurate, and low-cost solution for efficient detection of recycled ICs, even if they have been used for a very short period of time. The proposed solution utilizes a ring oscillator (RO), and a nonvolatile memory. It stores the RO frequency, conditions (e.g., supply voltage, temperature, and duration) for the frequency measurement, and a digital signature. The simulation and silicon results demonstrate that we can effectively detect recycled ICs used as low as one day.},

This is due to the communication networks between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors, which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or devices that are not sufficiently protected.

abstract={Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC's) 0.35-μm technology, we demonstrate the operation of two hardware Trojans, which leak the secret key of a wireless cryptographic integrated circuit (IC) consisting of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core and an ultrawideband (UWB) transmitter (TX). With their impact carefully hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process variations, these hardware Trojans cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and do not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB TX. Moreover, through physical measurements and MATLAB simulations, we show that the attack facilitated by these hardware Trojans is robust to test equipment and communication channel noise. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of a popular hardware Trojan detection method, namely, statistical side-channel fingerprinting via trained one-class classifiers, in detecting the hardware Trojans introduced in our fabricated IC population.},

abstract={Malicious tampering of the internal circuits of ICs can lead to detrimental results. Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection. It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100% coverage with low false positive rates.},

abstract={In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem. In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8%, 83.3%, 67.9%, and 25.4% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively, for a typical die at 25 °C, compared to baseline frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is suitable for wide-operating-range applications.},

abstract={We introduce a Concurrent Hardware Trojan Detection (CHTD) methodology for wireless cryptographic integrated circuits (ICs), based on continuous extraction of a side-channel fingerprint and evaluation by a trained on-chip neural classifier. While similar statistical side-channel fingerprinting methods have been extensively studied in the past, they operate either before an IC is deployed or, periodically, during idle times, after an IC is deployed. Therefore, they can be easily evaded by a hardware Trojan which remains dormant at all times except during normal operation. In contrast, the proposed methodology operates concurrently with the normal functionality of the IC and is, therefore, much harder to evade. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a hybrid experimentation platform consisting of (i) a custom-designed wireless cryptographic IC, infested with hardware Trojans that are controllable to be either active or dormant, (ii) a Spice-level simulation model of the fingerprint extraction circuit, and (iii) a custom-designed programmable analog neural network IC. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed CHTD methodology effectively identifies hardware Trojans when they are active, while not incurring any false positives when they are absent or dormant.},

abstract={Most of prior hardware Trojan detection approaches require golden chips for references. A classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique has been proposed in the authors' previous work. However, the algorithm in that work is trained by simulated ICs without considering a shift between the simulation and silicon fabrication. In this study, a co-training based hardware Trojan detection method by exploiting inaccurate simulation models and unlabeled fabricated ICs is proposed to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, which eliminates the need of golden chips. Two classification algorithms are trained using simulated ICs. These two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabelled ICs during test-time, and thus can label some of these ICs for the further training of the other algorithm. Moreover, a statistical examination is used to choose ICs labelling for the other algorithm. A statistical confidence interval based technique is also used to combine the hypotheses of the two classification algorithms. Furthermore, the partial least squares method is used to preprocess the raw data of ICs for feature selection. Both EDA experiment results and field programmable gate array (FPGA) experiment results show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy and recall.},

abstract={The counterfeiting and recycling of integrated circuits (ICs) have become major issues in recent years, potentially impacting the security and reliability of electronic systems bound for military, financial, or other critical applications. With identical functionality and packaging, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish recycled ICs from unused ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when used in the field. Recycled ICs detection based on aging in ring oscillators (ROs-based) and antifuse (AF-based) are the two techniques presented in this paper. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations' effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results using 90-nm technology and silicon results from 90-nm test chips show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows that recycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified.},

abstract={The recycling of used integrated circuits (ICs) has raised serious problems in ensuring the integrity of today's globalized semiconductor supply chain. This poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure due to potentially shorter lifetime, lower reliability, and poorer performance from these counterfeit new chips. Recently, we have proposed a highly effective approach for detecting such chips by exploiting the power-up state of on-chip SRAMs. Due to the symmetry of the memory array layout, an equal number of cells power-up to the 0 and 1 logic states in a new unused SRAM; this ratio gets skewed in time due to uneven NBTI aging from normal usage in the field. Although this solution is very effective in detecting recycled ICs, its applicability is somewhat limited as a large number older designs do not have large on-chip memories. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach based on the initial power-up state of scan flip-flops, which are present in virtually every digital circuit. Since the flip-flops, unlike SRAM cells, are generally not perfectly symmetrical in layout, an equal number of scan cells will not power-up to 0 or 1 logic states in most designs. Consequently, a stable time zero reference of 50% logic 0s and 1s cannot be used for determining the subsequent usage of a chip. To overcome this key limitation, we propose a novel solution in this paper that reliably identifies used ICs from testing the part alone, without the need for any additional reference data or even the netlist of the circuit. Through scan testing of the IC, we first identify a significant number of asymmetrically stressed flip-flops in the design, divided into two groups. One group of flip-flops is selected such that it mostly experiences the 1 logic state during functional operation, while the other group mostly experiences the 0 state. The resulting differential stress during operation causes growing disparity over time in the number of 0s (and 1s) observed in these two groups at power-up. When new and unaged, these two groups behave similarly, with similar percentage of 1s (or 0s). However, over time the differential stress makes these counts diverge. We show that this changing count can be a measure of operational aging. Our simulation results show that it is possible to reliably detect used ICs after as little as three months of operation.},

abstract={In this paper we present an unconventional anti ICS-malware approach. We leverage a factor that appears to be overlooked as of this writing, namely that ICS malware often infect machines which do not run any functions related to industrial process control. These may be, for example, business machines in the enterprise networks of power utility companies, or even random machines on the Internet. Because ICS environments use special-purpose communication protocols, it is highly unlikely that any application code on those machines will send or receive network traffic through an ICS communication protocol. On the other hand, ICS malware discover their targets via searches that initiate ICS communication protocol traffic. Our approach uses a kernel filter driver to analyze the network traffic that flows through a real NIC. The kernel filter driver works with a module that uses in-kernel ICS protocol signatures to recognize ICS protocol traffic embedded within the network traffic in question. Our approach can detect 0-day malware on machines that are unrelated to industrial process control, without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data. We performed extensive testing against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns, as well as safety and efficiency tests, and thus discuss the findings in the paper.},

abstract={The counterfeiting and recycled integrated circuits (ICs) has become a major security threat for commercial and military systems. In addition to the huge economic impacts, they post significant security and safety threats on those systems. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight on-chip aging sensor, which is based on the electromigration (EM)-induced aging effects for fast detection and prevention of recycled ICs. Our new EM-based aging sensor exploits the natural aging/failure mechanism of interconnect wires to time the aging of the chip. Compared with existing aging sensor, the new aging sensor can provide more accurate prediction of the chip usage time at smaller area footprints due to its simple structure. The new sensor is based on a newly proposed physics-based stress evolution model of EM effects for accurate prediction of the EM failure. As a result, we can design the interconnect wire structures based on copper interconnect technology so that the resulting wires will have detectable EM failure at a specific time with sufficient accuracy. In order to mitigate the problem of the inherent variations in the metal grain sizes and assess its impacts on the nucleation time of metal wires, a number of parallel properly structured wires are used in the sensor. The parameters of the wires are optimized using the new EM model.

abstract={Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have posed a major security and safety threat on commercial and mission-critical systems. In this paper, we propose to develop a comprehensive counterfeit ICs detection and prevention strategy, consisting of an innovative multi-functional on-chip sensor and a related post-fabrication authentication methodology. We target at many counterfeit ICs including the recycled/remarked/out-of-spec ICs, as well as cloned and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of antifuse memory and aging sensors to reduce reference circuit related area overhead of those sensor circuits. Second, the new sensor combines both the ring-oscillator based aging sensor with recently proposed electromigration(EM)-based aging sensor so that it can be effective for estimation of both short and long period time of chip usage. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed multi-functional sensor against existing on-chip sensors in terms of functionality, detection coverage and usage time estimation range and accuracy.},

Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB transmitter.

abstract={In this paper, we present a new approach for counterfeit protection against remarked, overproduced, and out-of-spec integrated circuits (ICs). Our approach uses identification sequences that are regularly published by the original chip manufacturer and hidden in the electromagnetic (EM) leakage of authentic chips. A portion of the chip area is dedicated to a crypto engine running in stream cipher mode that is initialized with a unique key and an initialization vector stored in one-time-programmable antifuse memory. IC identification is carried out in the field by obtaining EM measurements of deployed ICs and by proving the presence of the genuine identification sequences in the measurements. We evaluate our approach using a proof-of-concept implementation on three FPGA boards by capturing EM leakage of the FPGAs under test at their decoupling capacitors. The results show that the user can carry out IC identification on-site, using standard lab equipment in short amount of time.},

abstract={In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA) is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of SVM parameters selection.},

abstract={Physical attacks focus on extracting information from internal parts of IC's. One way to achieve this is by means of connecting probes to wires, so that the content of internal buses and registers can be revealed. Protection against this type of attacks exists, but usually is bulky and expensive, e.g. the shielding of secured areas. This paper presents a novel in-circuit countermeasure that is cheap and can easily be integrated in existing designs to detect probing attempts. It is based on a ring oscillator that operates over coupled lines in a differential mode. When the loading of one of the lines is unbalanced over a tolerance margin, an impulse is generated and integrated over time. If the integration surpasses a given threshold an alarm signal is activated. Simulations show the stability of the detector over a range of temperature and supply voltage variations.},

year={2018},

pages={1452-1457},
abstract={Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans. Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips. First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs. During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy (92%~97%) and recall (88%~95%).},

pages={2156-2165},
abstract={A wideband microwave method is described as a means for rapid detection of slight dissimilarities and aging effects in integrated circuits (ICs). The method is based on measuring the complex reflection coefficient of an IC when illuminated with an open-ended rectangular waveguide probe, at K-band (18-26.5 GHz) and Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz) microwave frequencies. The spatially integrated reflected electromagnetic signature of a given IC is a function of its internal material properties, geometry and metallic deposition of circuit element, and wire bonds. Consequently, dissimilar (including counterfeit) and aged ICs exhibit markedly different reflection properties than their reference and new (nonaged) counterparts. In addition to measuring spatially integrated complex reflection coefficient (over the waveguide aperture), it is also integrated over the operating frequency band (spectrally integrated), resulting in significant increase in the robustness of the approach. Root-mean-squared-error, defined as the average Euclidean distance between two reflection coefficient vectors, is used to associate a quantitative metric to the complex reflection coefficient difference between two dissimilar ICs. Measurement results on several sets of ICs having the same package (DIP-14) and different functionalities, similar functionalities with slight differences in specifications, and aged ICs are presented. The results clearly indicate the capability of this method to differentiate among ICs having slight differences in packaging material properties and/or electronic circuitry.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a two-step non-scan design-for-test methodology that can ease detection of an embedded Trojan and simultaneously partially obfuscates a design against Trojan implantations. In the first step, we use Q signals of flip-flops in a circuit to increase the number of reachable states. In the second step, we partition these flip-flops into different groups enhancing the state-space variation. Creation of these new reachable states helps to trigger and propagate the Trojan effect more easily. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show that this method can effectively uncover Trojans which are otherwise very difficult to detect in the normal functional mode. In addition, partitioning the flip-flops of the circuit into different groups and selecting the output (Q or Q) based on input controlled ENABLE signals conceal its actual functionality beyond simple recognition thereby making it difficult for the adversary to implant Trojans.},

abstract={For practical testing and detection of electromigration (EM) induced failures in dual damascene copper interconnects, one critical issue is creating stressing conditions to induce the chip to fail exclusively under EM in a very short period of time so that EM sign-off and validation can be carried out efficiently. Existing acceleration techniques, which rely on increasing temperature and current densities beyond the known limits, also accelerate other reliability effects making it very difficult, if not impossible, to test EM in isolation. In this paper, we propose novel EM wear-out acceleration techniques to address the aforementioned issue. First, we show that multisegment interconnects with reservoir and sink structures can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wear-out process. Based on this observation, we propose three strategies to accelerate EM induced failure: 1) reservoir-enhanced acceleration; 2) sink-enhanced acceleration; and 3) a hybrid method that combines both reservoir and sink structures. We then propose several configurable interconnect structures that exploit atomic reservoirs and sinks for accelerated EM testing. Such configurable interconnect structures are very flexible and can be used to achieve significant lifetime reductions at the cost of some routing resources. Using the proposed technique, EM testing can be carried out at nominal current densities, and at a much lower temperature compared to traditional testing methods. This is the most significant contribution of this paper since, to our knowledge, this is the only method that allows EM testing to be performed in a controlled environment without the risk of invoking other reliability effects that are also accelerated by elevated temperature and current density. The simulation results show that using the proposed method, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from ten years down to a few hours (about 105× acceleration) under the 150 °C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.},

abstract={Interconnect imperfections have become an issue in modern nanometer technologies. Some of them cause Small Delay Defects (SDDs) which are difficult to detect. Furthermore, those SDDs not detected during testing may pose a reliability problem. Nanometer issues (e.g. process variations, spatial correlations) represent important challenges for traditional delay test methods. In this paper, a technique to compute the probability of detection of resistive opens causing SDDs considering process variations is proposed. This technique is used to estimate the Statistical Fault Coverage (SFC) of a circuit. In order to estimate the SFC of a circuit, the delays are propagated using statistical timing analysis, and the analyzed space of possible delay fault locations is obtained using stratified sampling techniques. This methodology is applied to some ISCAS benchmark circuits. The obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Measures can be taken for those circuits presenting non-acceptable fault coverage in order to improve their test quality.},

Finally, an anomaly detection algorithm based on hybrid differential cumulative is used to identify the specific anomaly data in the anomaly node. The stability of causality mining algorithm and the validity of locating causality anomalies are verified by using the data of classical chemical process.

In this work, we propose novel EM wearout-acceleration techniques for practical VLSI chips. We will first review the recently proposed three-phase physics-based EM models and discuss the important factors contributing to the EM aging process. Then we propose a new formula for fast estimation of the void's saturation volume for general multi-segment interconnect wires, which is important for EM mortality check. We then investigate two strategies to accelerate the EM failure process: reservoir-enhanced acceleration and temperature-based acceleration. First we show that multi-segment interconnects with reservoir structures and their stressing currents can be exploited to significantly speedup the EM wearout process. Such configurable reservoir-based wires are very flexible and can achieve various EM accelerations at the costs of some routing resources. Additionally, we show that further acceleration can be achieved by increasing temperature. On average, 10% increase in temperature yields about 10X wearout acceleration. However, purely temperature based acceleration is not possible since practical VLSI chips have temperature limitations which must be strictly enforced to ensure the chip only fails under EM, and not due to other reliability effects. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve significantly high acceleration while staying within the feasible operating zones by combining the two acceleration techniques. Experimental results show that by combining temperature and reservoir accelerations, we can reduce the EM lifetime of a chip from 10 years down to a few hours (about 105 acceleration) under the 150°C temperature limit, which is sufficient for practical EM testing of typical nanometer CMOS ICs.},

abstract={Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control devices. The control devices are interconnected via modern control communication bus such as ModbusTCP which now leverages Ethernet to allow interoperability between different solutions and vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. This presentation discusses diversified redundant architecture as a cyber-resilient system for networked control devices which maintains their normal operation even under compromised situations. This operation-based resilient architecture adds an isolated device, functionally equivalent to the networked primary device but with essential safe-mode operation features only, which is naturally immune to cyber incidents. In addition, a supervisor component monitors the operation of both networked and isolated devices, and transfers control to the safe-mode isolated device if the networked device operates abnormally, assuming that the abnormal operation is resulted from malicious hacking which has not been detected from the network cyber security defense. However, even with its resiliency, the diversified architecture has its own blind side — unawareness of presence of hacking traffic on the control bus when operational changes are not made by the hackers. Therefore, to solve this problem of unawareness of and undetected intrusion, we improve the architecture with an additional feature of intrusion detection utilizing open source software called Snort. The security features of Snort are incorporated as an intrusion detection and awareness solution, and are customized into the supervisor component of the diversified architecture for Modbus TCP/IP traffic monitoring. In laboratory tests, the added feature of intrusion detection has successfully initiated a safe-mode control transfer to the isolated device upon detection of unusual data traffic on the control bus. With this bus monitoring and intrusion detection, the diversified architecture would become a truly resilient and secure networked industrial control system.},
