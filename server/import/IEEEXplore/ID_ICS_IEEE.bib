abstract={In recent years, the number of information security incidents of industry controlling system has increased dramatically. The intrusion detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive attention. As one of powerful and light weight Network Intrusion Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP is very important for the industry controlling systems which use Profinet to connect. To realize the detection for Profinet RT signal, this paper expanded the snort packet decoding engine, and designed a preprocessor plug-ins for Profinet RT signal. Experimental result shows that the improved Snort can support the intrusion detection for Profinet RT signal.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are related to all aspects of human life and have become the target of many cyber-attackers. Attacks on industrial control systems may not only cause monetary loss, but also damage equipment, the environment and hurt staff, such as the Stuxnet and the cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid. So the intrusion detection of ICS has a great significance. This paper based on the intrusion detection by telemetry analysis, optimized the system model, captured the communication packets between different nodes in the system, then extracted features for machine learning to achieve malicious traffic detection, and the attack types are further distinguished. Telemetry means that it does not need to enter the industrial control system network, but by capturing data packets remotely to achieve intrusion detection.},

abstract={It is difficult to prevent attackers from intruding into the industrial control system(ICS) physically, who can connect external devices to the system to steal information or inject false data. In this paper, a physical intrusion detection method is proposed for ICS, by analyzing the communication signal at physical layer. RS485, one of the most important and widely-used serial bus, is selected to investigate how the intruded devices influence the voltage signal in ICS network. The model of voltage signal in RS485 communication lines is built to represent the difference caused by the variation of devices and detect the intruded devices. In the simulation, we demonstrate how to detect an intruded device in a two-device RS485 system.},

abstract={In view of the problem that the intrusion detection method based on One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) could not detect the outliers within the industrial data, which results in the decision function deviating from the training sample, an anomaly intrusion detection algorithm based on Robust Incremental Principal Component Analysis (RIPCA) -OCSVM is proposed in this paper. The method uses RIPCA algorithm to remove outliers in industrial data sets and realize dimensionality reduction. In combination with the advantages of OCSVM on the single classification problem, an anomaly detection model is established, and the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) is used for model parameter optimization. The simulation results show that the method can efficiently and accurately identify attacks or abnormal behaviors while meeting the real-time requirements of the industrial control system (ICS).},

abstract={Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used “air-gap” security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect. Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted through the network but is not inherently the data used by the transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker and engineer on the Internet.},

abstract={Modbus over TCP/IP is one of the most popular industrial network protocol that are widely used in critical infrastructures. However, vulnerability of Modbus TCP protocol has attracted widely concern in the public. The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic. SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false negative.},

abstract={An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The device fingerprinting- based intrusion classification and detection approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.},

pages={3630-3635},
abstract={In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA) is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of SVM parameters selection.},

abstract={Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control devices. The control devices are interconnected via modern control communication bus such as ModbusTCP which now leverages Ethernet to allow interoperability between different solutions and vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. This presentation discusses diversified redundant architecture as a cyber-resilient system for networked control devices which maintains their normal operation even under compromised situations. This operation-based resilient architecture adds an isolated device, functionally equivalent to the networked primary device but with essential safe-mode operation features only, which is naturally immune to cyber incidents. In addition, a supervisor component monitors the operation of both networked and isolated devices, and transfers control to the safe-mode isolated device if the networked device operates abnormally, assuming that the abnormal operation is resulted from malicious hacking which has not been detected from the network cyber security defense. However, even with its resiliency, the diversified architecture has its own blind side — unawareness of presence of hacking traffic on the control bus when operational changes are not made by the hackers. Therefore, to solve this problem of unawareness of and undetected intrusion, we improve the architecture with an additional feature of intrusion detection utilizing open source software called Snort. The security features of Snort are incorporated as an intrusion detection and awareness solution, and are customized into the supervisor component of the diversified architecture for Modbus TCP/IP traffic monitoring. In laboratory tests, the added feature of intrusion detection has successfully initiated a safe-mode control transfer to the isolated device upon detection of unusual data traffic on the control bus. With this bus monitoring and intrusion detection, the diversified architecture would become a truly resilient and secure networked industrial control system.},
