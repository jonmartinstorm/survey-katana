abstract={Current intrusion detection system (IDS) technology is not suited to be widely deployed inside a supervisory, control and data acquisition (SCADA) environment. Anomaly- and signature-based IDS technologies have developed methods to cover information technology-based networks activity and protocols effectively. However, these IDS technologies do not include the fine protocol granularity required to ensure network security inside an environment with weak protocols lacking authentication and encryption. By implementing a more specific and more intelligent packet inspection mechanism, tailored traffic flow analysis, and unique packet tampering detection, IDS technology developed specifically for SCADA environments can be deployed with confidence in detecting malicious activity.},

abstract={The present paper describes some issues in working with large data files downloaded from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (S.C.A.D.A) systems. The data files management was possible by implementing two high level software applications. The first high level application converts and extracts relevant data from different types of very large S.C.A.D.A downloaded files - Microsoft Excel files format into Microsoft Access Databases (MBD), containing hundreds of million of records. The second high level application displays a two dimensional graph for sensor values on a specified period of time. In this way we can observe the sensor evolution and closely monitoring some possible “mission - critical” situations which can badly disturb the functionality of the entire system.},

abstract={Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including electric power, oil & gas and others. The protocols used in this domain were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks, leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple language grammar allows network engineers to describe system characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS. An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring needs.},

The processes which are used for monitoring techniques are most important in practice and based on models constructed. A new approach to failure detection and isolation either remove the faulty system or convert it into backward error recovery system. In PLC controlled flexible fault detection and manufacturing systems, there is no automatic fault detection module in PLC controller itself, so additional module required to be improved. The New fault detection and fault finding system based on measured data from the detection machines and sensor data. In this system PLC internal program detects and find the fault on the basis of sensor and measured data. The fault detection is analysis on the basis of comparing normal condition with abnormal condition. Generally, fault detection via Allen Bradley PLC program execution can provide greater fault coverage across a processor-chip compared to error coding techniques on individual hardware structures. This paper includes three types of failure of fault detection in boiler which are major caused in steam power Plant during operation. In this whole process SCADA is used for Real time visualization.

abstract={GPS receiver is the source of synchronization in phasor measurement unit (PMU) networks. While it guarantees time precision, it is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may modify the time offset and results in mismatches in time. This modification (GPS spoofing attack) changes the phase angle of signals measured by PMU. This article deals with three important challenges in GPS spoofing attack detection; first, multiattack detection while there are probable attacks on different PMUs, second, attack detection considering the dynamic model of power systems, and third, measurement correction. For providing solution to the abovementioned problems, an anti-GPS spoofing attack mechanism is suggested, in which, a dynamic filter with the help of PMU and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems measurements estimate the phase shifts caused by spoofing attacks. The results of data fusion of PMUs and SCADA in the detection method are shown. Numerical results demonstrate that this approach can detect dynamic spoofing attacks in a reasonable time and as soon as multiple attacks are detected, corrected measurements are provided.},

Supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) data of a wind turbine is adopted and several parameters are selected based on physic knowledge and correlation coefficient analysis to build a normal behavior model. This model is based on Self-organizing map (SOM) which can project higher dimensional SCADA data into a two-dimension-map. After that, the Euclidean distance based indicator for system level anomalies is defined and a filter is created to screen out suspicious data points based on quantile function. Moreover, a failure data pattern based criterion is created for anomaly detection from system level. The method is tested with a two-month SCADA dataset with the measurement interval as 20 seconds. Results demonstrate capability and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The NBMs for 14 temperature parameters of SCADA system are developed by using back propagation neural networks (BPNNs). The proposed method is verified by a case of a 1.5MW WT fault.

abstract={A fiber optics based sensing network applicable for fault detection in power system is presented. The proposed scheme is secure and immune from interferences. At each monitoring location, passive rugged fiber-Bragg-grating-based sensors are deployed. They use fast and compact magnetostrictive transducers instead of current or potential transformers to translate current induced magnetic field into optical signal. These sensors can be compensated for temperature drift and easily be integrated into an optical sensing network. A broadband light source at a substation scans the change in reflected optical power at a unique frequency band that corresponds to the surge in magnetic field associated with an increased fault current at a certain location. A unique feature of this real-time scheme is that it only requires current information for fault detections in both radial and networked systems with various pole structures and line configurations. It can easily coordinate with other protective devices and is free from any time-current coordination curves. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested by simulations. They confirm that the proposed scheme is able to detect the faults irrespective of the type and location. It also performs well in presence of harmonics, high impedance, and sensors malfunctions, as well as sensor noise. PLC/SCADA technology is associated to each sensor allowing the high impedance fault occurrence information to reach the protection equipment located closer to or at the substation},

abstract={World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed “What-if” module.},

abstract={The integration of networks within an organization made many critical infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet. CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them, thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable configurations on critical infrastructure network devices.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in real-time systems is a problem without a profound solution. In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of OCSVM models. These trained models run in parallel and can accurately and fast recognise different types of attacks.},

abstract={Developing effective wind turbine fault detection algorithm is not only meaningful for improving wind turbine reliability but also crucial for future intelligent wind farm operation and management. Typical wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring is based on vibration signals, which is effective to detect failures with high frequency signal range. But it may not be effective on low speed components which have low frequency signal characteristic of different failure modes. SCADA system collecting multiple low frequency signals provides a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines health and performance, while its capability on fault detection is still an open issue. To systematic understand wind turbine systems, this paper presents research results of model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection. Through a detail analysis of thermodynamic process of gearbox lubrication system, a wind turbine drive train model which considers heat transferring mechanism in gearbox lubrication system is built to derive robust relationships between transmission efficiency, temperature, and rotational speed signals of wind turbine gearbox and suggest useful information for lubrication system design and optimization. The result obtained in this work is useful for wind turbine gearbox design and effective algorithm development of fault detection.},

abstract={Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.},

abstract={In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Energy theft has been a serious and long existing problem facing by many power utilities. The implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) provides power companies with new means for energy theft detection. As fundamental equipment of AMI, smart meters collect interval measurements from customer sites and thus provide system wide visibility for power companies. Leveraging both AMI and SCADA measurements, this paper puts forward an integrated distribution state estimation method for medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution network. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can achieve a higher accuracy level for estimation. Furthermore, an energy theft detection method is proposed based on "weight-dropped polling" integrated distribution state estimation. Simulations show that it can deliver promising results comparing with conventional state estimation methods.},

abstract={Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring. Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F1 score of respectively > 99%.},

An insider attack occurs when an authorized operator misuse the permissions, and brings catastrophic damages by sending legitimate control commands. Therefore, insider attacks have great impact and higher success rate, and it is difficult to predict and protect against them. This paper, by study on the SCADA alarms, proposes a new alarm based statistical anomaly detection method to identify potential insider attacks at substations and total transmission system in power grid. To demonstrate the proposed method, two insider attack scenarios have been simulated at both substations level and transmission system. Experimental scenarios illustrate proposed method is effective, and anomalies can be detected by minimum number of alarms.},

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism.},

abstract={Power grid is an important element of the cyber physical systems. Attacks on such infrastructure may have catastrophic impact and hence the mitigation solutions for the attacks are necessary. It is impractical to test attacks and mitigation strategies on real networks. A testbed as a platform bridges the cyber-physical divide by bringing in the physical system inside the cyber domain, and test the attack scenarios. We are proposing such a testbed here that can simulate power systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The testbed consists of traffic generator, simulated devices like Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Master Terminal Unit (MTU), Human Machine Interface (HMI) etc. and the communication channel wrapped around industrial communication protocols such as IEC-60870-5-101 and DNP3. The proposed testbed includes with a comparator module which helps in detecting potential intrusions at RTU. A compromised RTU can be manipulated to send fabricated commands in the grid or to send polled responses from the grid. Detecting compromised systems at early stages helps in reducing damage to Industrial Control System (ICS) and providing higher security measures.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its statistical performance is also compared with several conventional quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and false isolation.},

abstract={European Starlings and other bird's flocks in thousands and even millions. Their flocking behaviors attract predators that see such collective behavior as an easy target. However, the surprising thing is that it is harder to target and capture one in their mist than a lone bird. It is easy to target and capture a lone bird than a bird in a flock. One of these collective behaviors is the capability of each of them to detect a predator. Each one in the flock can detect a predator some meters away. The more they are in number, the harder it will be not to detect the incoming predator. This paper proposed modelling the same approach for securing Industrial Control System (ICS) and in particular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, this approach seen in the flock of birds can be replicated in computer system for securing it. Train system was used as a testbed in this paper for data collection. Live data from the train system was collected, analyzed and some risk points were discovered. This risk points were the entry points for anomalies into the system. These are the points that needs securing. The model was to show the viability of using the approach as well as integrating it on SCADA systems, and the train system was a representation of SCADA system. This approach is purely distributed in the sense that each bird is capable of detecting a predator. The detection of anomalies is based on the location of each bird in the system. The bird's environment has cells and each cell has number. The maximum number of birds each cell can contain was six. Six birds approach was used for the detection and this can be seen in the model. Whenever a packet arrives, the first cell that contain six birds will be activated for detection. Birds in the cell has numbers and the activity is based on the number. The results showed that both known and unknow anomalies can be detected on SCADA systems.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)networks are widely deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs)such as energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution, and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.},

abstract={The power SCADA systems have been undergoing several upgrades over the years. At first, these systems were based only on isolated processes, without the need to connect in a global network, such as the Internet. In recent years, the access to such an open network has been critical for the SCADA systems, due to the need for data exchange across large areas, between geographically remote industrial plants, or even because of the demand for remote applications. Despite the SCADA systems have advantages by being now connected to a network such as the Internet, several problems can arise due to that. For example, such a connection makes it possible for an intruder to compromise the whole system. SCADA systems are essential in the new concept of smart grids and are widely used in the monitoring and control of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based on photovoltaics. In that context, this paper presents an overview of the main attacks found and documented in the literature, as well as possible techniques to detect such attacks.},

SCADA systems were originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol communications.

The approach applies the information in supervisory control and data acquisition systems as data input. First, machine learning is used to estimate the temperature signals of the gearbox component. Then the approach analyzes the deviations between the estimated values and the measurements of the signals. Finally, the information of alarm logs is integrated with the previous analysis to determine the operation states of wind turbines. The proposed approach has been tested with the data experience of a 2MW wind turbine in Sweden. The result demonstrates that the approach can detect possible anomalies before the failure occurrence. It also certifies that the approach can remind operators of the possible changes inside wind turbines even when the alarm logs do not report any alarms.},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State University Starkville, MS, USA.

In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the network control plane and /or the data plane.

To achieve these objectives, we start from the factors that impact the design of dedicated intrusion detection systems in SCADA networks and focus on network-based IDS solutions. We propose a structured evaluation methodology that encompasses detection techniques, protected protocols, implementation tools, test environments and IDS performance. Special attention is focused on assessing implementation maturity as well as the applicability of each surveyed solution in the Future Internet environment. Based on that, we provide a brief description and evaluation of 26 selected research papers, published in the period 2015-2019.

abstract={Given the importance of an early anomaly detection, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are introduced in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Agents or probes form the cornerstone of any IDS by capturing network packets and extracting relevant information. However, IDSs are facing unprecedented challenges due to the escalation in the number, scale and diversity of attacks. Software-Defined Network (SDN) then comes into play and can provide the required flexibility and scalability. Building on that, we introduce Traffic Agent Controllers (TACs) that monitor SDN-enabled switches via Open-Flow. By using lightweight statistical metrics such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), we are able to detect the slightest anomalies, such as stealth port scans, even in the presence of background traffic. The obtained metrics can also be used to locate the anomalies with precision over 90% inside a hierarchical network topology.},

pages={341-348},
abstract={Pointer taintedness is a concept which has been successfully employed as basis for vulnerability analysis of C/C ++ source code, and as a run-time mitigation technique against memory corruption attacks. Nevertheless, pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis may have no visibility on certain low-level vulnerabilities since there may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are related to a dynamic organization of data in memory. In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of industrial control protocols.},

To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with and without the TFIDS.},

The proposed method is tested using MODBUS protocol used for communication between a SCADA server and field devices in a SCADA system.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%.},

abstract={The increased complexity and interconnectivity of SCADA infrastructure in the power system have exposed it to the multitude of vulnerabilities. There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later, compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.},

These systems are increasingly the target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS, Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control protocol.

abstract={The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve. Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be determined.},

abstract={The massive use of information and communication technologies in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of lp-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks.},

abstract={Recently an efficient off-line approach to validate (detect, identify and correct) branch parameter errors using several snapshots of SCADA measurements was developed. This paper extends this approach in order to incorporate synchronized phasor measurements, which are provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Branches suspected of having parameters errors are identified through an Identification Index, which is computed based on the normalized residuals of SCADA and PMU measurements. The suspicious branch parameters are estimated in a sequential form using several measurement snapshots of SCADA and PMU measurements. This estimation process is executed via an augmented state-parameter estimator, which increases the conventional V-θ state vector for the inclusion of suspicious branch parameters. Several test results have demonstrated the high correctness and reliability of the proposed approach to treat single and multiple parameter errors in adjacent and non-adjacent branches and even in branches connected in a radial manner forming critical parameter k-tuples.},

abstract={Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall; accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate may change significantly when considering various attack types and different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical infrastructures.},

abstract={SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) databases have three main features that identify them as big data systems: volume, variety and velocity. SCADAs are extremely important for the safety and security operation of modern power system and provide essential online information about the power system state to system operators. A current research challenge is to efficiently process this big data, which involves real-time measurements of hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important events that affect the system.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems. There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={1-1},
abstract={In recent years, there have been several reports of blade damage caused by lightning strikes on wind turbines. A few of these accidents have resulted in more serious secondary damage owing to the continued rotation of the damaged blades. To prevent the initial damage from spreading in this manner, wind farms in the regions of Japan vulnerable to winter lightning were required to introduce lightning detection systems, which can accurately detect when lightning strikes the wind turbine and then immediately stop the rotation of the blades. Normally, when the system detects a lightning strike to a wind turbine and stops operation, the process of restarting is initiated only after the soundness of the blades is confirmed by visual inspection. However, in bad weather, it is often difficult to check the soundness of the blade visually, and the resulting delay in the restart process prolongs the downtime and reduces the availability of the wind turbine. In this paper, we report the results of using the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data to check the soundness of the blades after a lightning strike to resume operations more quickly, thereby increasing up-time.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data. The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06%, 37.34%, and 26.76% and improves the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57%, 4.19%, and 3.78% using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively.},

abstract={Emerging cybersecurity vulnerabilities in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are becoming urgent engineering issues for modern substations. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) tailored for cybersecurity of IEC 61850 based substations. The proposed IDS integrates physical knowledge, protocol specifications, and logical behaviors to provide a comprehensive and effective solution that is able to mitigate various cyberattacks. The proposed approach comprises access control detection, protocol whitelisting, model-based detection, and multiparameter-based detection. This SCADA-specific IDS is implemented and validated using a comprehensive and realistic cyber-physical test-bed and data from a real 500 kV smart substation.},

abstract={SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units; however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control devices. A support vector of type “Class One” machine and a test lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.},
